</div>

<p class='c008'><cite>Sketches of the Principal Picture-Galleries in England. With a Criticism on ‘Marriage
a-la-mode,’</cite> appeared in a small 8vo. volume (6½ in. × 4 in.) in 1824, ‘Printed for
Taylor and Hessey, 93, Fleet-Street, and 13, Waterloo-Place, Pall-Mall.’ The
last page bears advertisements of the <cite>Characters of Shakspeare’s Plays</cite>, <cite>Lectures on
the English Poets</cite>, and <cite>Lectures on the English Comic Writers</cite>. The printer’s name,
given behind the half-title, is ‘T. Green, 76 Fleet-street.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Four pages of Taylor &amp; Hessey’s announcements (‘Booksellers to H.R.H. the
Prince Leopold’) are bound up with the volume.</p>

<p class='c000'>The present text is that of the 1824 volume.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Sketches</cite> formed part of the two volumes of ‘Criticisms on Art,’ collected
and edited by his son in 1843–4, and of the one volume of ‘Essays on the Fine
Arts,’ edited by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt in 1873.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>ADVERTISEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is the object of the following little work to give an account of
the principal Picture-Galleries in this country, and to describe the
feelings which they naturally excite in the mind of a lover of art.
Almost all those of any importance have been regularly gone through.
One or two, that still remain unnoticed, may be added to our <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catalogue
raisonnée</span></i> at a future opportunity. It may not be improper to mention
here that Mr. Angerstein’s pictures have been lately purchased for the
commencement of a National Gallery, but are still to be seen in their
old places on the walls of his house.</p>

<p class='c008'>MR. ANGERSTEIN’S COLLECTION</p>

<p class='c000'>Oh! Art, lovely Art! ‘Balm of hurt minds, chief nourisher in life’s
feast, great Nature’s second course!’ Time’s treasurer, the unsullied
mirror of the mind of man! Thee we invoke, and not in vain, for
we find thee here retired in thy plentitude and thy power! The
walls are dark with beauty; they frown severest grace. The eye
is not caught by glitter and varnish; we see the pictures by their own
internal light. This is not a bazaar, a raree-show of art, a Noah’s
ark of all the Schools, marching out in endless procession; but a
sanctuary, a holy of holies, collected by taste, sacred to fame,
enriched by the rarest products of genius. For the number of
pictures, Mr. Angerstein’s is the finest gallery, perhaps, in the world.
We feel no sense of littleness: the attention is never distracted for
a moment, but concentrated on a few pictures of first-rate excellence.
Many of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> might occupy the spectator for a whole
morning; yet they do not interfere with the pleasure derived from each
other—so much consistency of style is there in the midst of variety!</p>

<p class='c000'>We know of no greater treat than to be admitted freely to a
Collection of this sort, where the mind reposes with full confidence
in its feelings of admiration, and finds that idea and love of conceivable
beauty, which it has cherished perhaps for a whole life, reflected
from every object around it. It is a cure (for the time at least) for
low-thoughted cares and uneasy passions. We are abstracted to
another sphere: we breathe empyrean air; we enter into the minds
of Raphael, of Titian, of Poussin, of the Caracci, and look at nature
with their eyes; we live in time past, and seem identified with the
permanent forms of things. The business of the world at large, and
even its pleasures, appear like a vanity and an impertinence. What
signify the hubbub, the shifting scenery, the fantoccini figures, the
folly, the idle fashions without, when compared with the solitude,
the silence, the speaking looks, the unfading forms within?—Here is
the mind’s true home. The contemplation of truth and beauty is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>proper object for which we were created, which calls forth the most
intense desires of the soul, and of which it never tires. A capital
print-shop (Molteno’s or Colnaghi’s) is a point to aim at in a
morning’s walk—a relief and satisfaction in the motley confusion,
the littleness, the vulgarity of common life: but a print-shop has
but a mean, cold, meagre, petty appearance after coming out of a
fine Collection of Pictures. We want the size of life, the marble
flesh, the rich tones of nature, the diviner expanded expression.
Good prints are no doubt, better than bad pictures; or prints,
generally speaking, are better than pictures; for we have more
prints of good pictures than of bad ones: yet they are for the most
part but hints, loose memorandums, outlines in little of what the
painter has done. How often, in turning over a number of choice
engravings, do we tantalise ourselves by thinking ‘what a head <em>that</em>
must be,’—in wondering what colour a piece of drapery is of, green
or black,—in wishing, in vain, to know the exact tone of the sky
in a particular corner of the picture! Throw open the folding-doors
of a fine Collection, and you see all you have desired realised
at a blow—the bright originals starting up in their own proper shape,
clad with flesh and blood, and teeming with the first conceptions of
the painter’s mind! The disadvantage of pictures is, that they cannot
be multiplied to any extent, like books or prints; but this, in another
point of view, operates probably as an advantage, by making the sight
of a fine original picture an event so much the more memorable, and
the impression so much the deeper. A visit to a genuine Collection
is like going a pilgrimage—it is an act of devotion performed at the
shrine of Art! It is as if there were but one copy of a book in the
world, locked up in some curious casket, which, by special favour,
we had been permitted to open, and peruse (as we must) with
unaccustomed relish. The words would in that case leave stings
in the mind of the reader, and every letter appear of gold. The
ancients, before the invention of printing, were nearly in the same
situation with respect to books, that we are with regard to pictures;
and at the revival of letters, we find the same unmingled satisfaction, or
fervid enthusiasm, manifested in the pursuit or the discovery of an old
manuscript, that connoisseurs still feel in the purchase and possession
of an antique cameo, or a fine specimen of the Italian school of painting.
Literature was not then cheap and vulgar, nor was there what is
called a <em>reading public</em>; and the pride of intellect, like the pride of art,
or the pride of birth, was confined to the privileged few!</p>

<p class='c000'>We sometimes, in viewing a celebrated Collection, meet with an
old favourite, a <em>first love</em> in such matters, that we have not seen for
many years, which greatly enhances the delight. We have, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>pampered our imaginations with it all that time; its charms have
sunk deep into our minds; we wish to see it once more, that we
may confirm our judgment, and renew our vows. The <cite>Susannah and
the Elders</cite> at Mr. Angerstein’s was one of those that came upon us
under these circumstances. We had seen it formerly, among other
visions of our youth, in the Orleans Collection,—where we used to
go and look at it by the hour together, till our hearts thrilled with
its beauty, and our eyes were filled with tears. How often had we
thought of it since, how often spoken of it!—There it was still, the
same lovely phantom as ever—not as when Rousseau met Madame
de Warens, after a lapse of twenty years, who was grown old and
wrinkled—but as if the young Jewish Beauty had been just surprised
in that unguarded spot—crouching down in one corner of the picture,
the face turned back with a mingled expression of terror, shame, and
unconquerable sweetness, and the whole figure (with the arms crossed)
shrinking into itself with bewitching grace and modesty! It is by
Ludovico Caracci, and is worthy of his name, from its truth and
purity of design, its expression and its mellow depth of tone. Of
the <cite>Elders</cite>, one is represented in the attitude of advancing towards
her, while the other beckons her to rise. We know of no painter
who could have improved upon the Susannah, except Correggio, who,
with all his capricious blandishments, and wreathed angelic smiles,
would hardly have given the same natural unaffected grace, the same
perfect womanhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is but one other picture in the Collection, that strikes us, as
a matter of taste or fancy, like this; and that is the <cite>Silenus teaching a
Young Apollo to play on the pipe</cite>—a small oblong picture, executed in
distemper, by Annibal Caracci. The old preceptor is very fine, with
a jolly, leering, pampered look of approbation, half inclining to the
brute, half-conscious of the God; but it is the Apollo that constitutes
the charm of the picture, and is indeed divine. The whole figure is
full of simple careless grace, laughing in youth and beauty; he holds
the Pan’s-pipe in both hands, looking up with timid wonder; and
the expression of delight and surprise at the sounds he produces is
not to be surpassed. The only image we would venture to compare
with it for innocent artless voluptuousness, is that of the shepherd-boy
in Sir Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, ‘piping as though he should never be
old!’ A comparison of this sort, we believe, may be made, in spite
of the proverb, without injustice to the painter or the poet. Both
gain by it. The idea conveyed by the one, perhaps, receives an
additional grace and lustre, while a more beautiful moral sentiment
hovers round the other, from thinking of them in this casual connection.
If again it be asked, <em>Which is the most admirable?</em>—we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>answer—Both are equally exquisite in their way, and yield the
imagination all the pleasure it is capable of—and should decline
giving an invidious preference to either. <em>The cup can only be full.</em>
The young shepherd in the Arcadia wants no outward grace to
recommend him; the stripling God no hidden charm of expression.
The language of painting and poetry is intelligible enough to mortals;
the spirit of both is divine, and far too good for him, who, instead of
enjoying to the utmost height, would find an unwelcome flaw in
either. The <cite>Silenus and Apollo</cite> has something of a Raffaellesque
air, with a mixture of Correggio’s arch sensibility—there is nothing
of Titian in the colouring—yet Annibal Caracci was in theory a
deserter from the first to the two last of these masters; and swore
with an oath, in a letter to his uncle Ludovico, that ‘they were the
only true painters!’</p>

<p class='c000'>We should nearly have exhausted our stock of enthusiasm in
descanting on these two compositions, in almost any other case;
but there is no danger of this in the present instance. If we were
at any loss in this respect, we should only have to turn to the large
picture of the <cite>Raising of Lazarus</cite>, by Sebastian del Piombo;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘and still walking under,</div>
      <div class='line'>Find some new matter to look up and wonder.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We might dwell on the masterly strength of the drawing, the
gracefulness of the principal female figures, the high-wrought execution,
the deep, rich, <em>mosaic</em> colouring, the massiness and bustle of
the back-ground. We think this one of the best pictures on so
large a scale that we are anywhere acquainted with. The whole
management of the design has a very noble and imposing effect,
and each part severally will bear the closest scrutiny. It is a
magnificent structure built of solid and valuable materials. The
artist has not relied merely on the extent of his canvas, or the
importance of his subject, for producing a striking result—the effect
is made out by an aggregate of excellent parts. The hands, the
feet, the drapery, the heads, the features, are all fine. There is
some satisfaction in looking at a large historical picture, such as
this: for you really gain in quantity, without losing in quality;
and have a studious imitation of individual nature, combined with
masculine invention, and the comprehensive arrangement of an
interesting story. The Lazarus is very fine and bold. The flesh
is well-baked, dingy, and ready to crumble from the touch, when
it is liberated from its dread confinement to have life and motion
impressed on it again. He seems impatient of restraint, gazes
eagerly about him, and looks out from his shrouded prison on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>new world with hurried amazement, as if Death had scarcely yet
resigned his power over the senses. We would wish our artists to
look at the legs and feet of this figure, and see how correctness of
finishing and a greatness of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> in design are compatible with, and
set off each other. The attendant female figures have a peculiar
grace and becoming dignity, both of expression and attitude. They
are in a style something between Michael Angelo and Parmegiano.
They take a deep interest in the scene, but it is with the air of
composure proper to the sex, who are accustomed by nature and
duty to works of charity and compassion. The head of the old
man, kneeling behind Christ, is an admirable study of drawing,
execution, and character. The Christ himself is grave and earnest,
with a noble and impressive countenance; but the figure wants that
commanding air which ought to belong to one possessed of preternatural
power, and in the act of displaying it. Too much praise
cannot be given to the back-ground—the green and white draperies
of some old people at a distance, which are as airy as they are
distinct—the buildings like tombs—and the different groups, and
processions of figures, which seem to make life almost as grave
and solemn a business as death itself. This picture is said by some
to have been designed by Michael Angelo, and painted by Sebastian
del Piombo, in rivalship of some of Raphael’s works. It was in the
Orleans Gallery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near this large historical composition stands (or is suspended in
a case) a single head, by Raphael, of Pope Julius II. It is in itself
a Collection—a world of thought and character. There is a
prodigious weight and gravity of look, combined with calm self-possession,
and easiness of temper. It has the cast of an English
countenance, which Raphael’s portraits often have, Titian’s never.
In Raphael’s the mind, or the body, frequently prevails; in Titian’s
you always see the soul—faces ‘which pale passion loves.’ Look
at the Music-piece by Titian, close by in this Collection—it is
‘all ear,’—the expression is evanescent as the sounds—the features
are seen in a sort of dim <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro scuro</span></i>, as if the confused impressions
of another sense intervened—and you might easily suppose some of
the performers to have been engaged the night before in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>‘Mask or midnight serenade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which the starved lover to his mistress sings,</div>
      <div class='line'>Best quitted with disdain.’<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The ruddy, <em>bronzed</em> colouring of Raphael generally takes off from
any appearance of nocturnal watching and languid hectic passion!
The portrait of Julius II. is finished to a great nicety. The hairs
of the beard, the fringe on the cap, are done by minute and careful
touches of the pencil. In seeing the labour, the conscientious and
modest pains, which this great painter bestowed upon his smallest
works, we cannot help being struck with the number and magnitude
of those he left behind him. When we have a single portrait placed
before us, that might seem to have taken half a year to complete it,
we wonder how the same painter could find time to execute his
Cartoons, the compartments of the Vatican, and a thousand other
matchless works. The same account serves for both. The more
we do, the more we can do. Our leisure (though it may seem
a paradox) is in proportion to our industry. The same habit of
intense application, which led our artist to bestow as much pains
and attention on the study of a single head, as if his whole reputation
had depended on it, enabled him to set about the greatest works
with alacrity, and to finish them with ease. If he had done any
thing he undertook to do, in a slovenly disreputable manner, he
would (upon the same principle) have lain idle half his time. Zeal
and diligence, in this view, make life, short as it is, long.—Neither
did Raphael, it should seem, found his historical pretensions on his
incapacity to paint a good portrait. On the contrary, the latter here
looks very much like the corner-stone of the historical edifice. Nature
did not <em>put him out</em>. He was not too great a genius to copy what he
saw. He probably thought that a deference to nature is the
beginning of art, and that the highest eminence is scaled by single
steps!</p>

<p class='c000'>On the same stand as the portrait of Julius <span class='fss'>II.</span> is the much vaunted
Correggio—the <cite>Christ in the Garden</cite>. We would not give a farthing
for it. The drapery of the Christ is highly finished in a silver and
azure tone—but high finishing is not all we ask from Correggio.
It is more worthy of Carlo Dolce.—Lest we should forget it, we
may mention here, that the admired portrait of Govarcius was gone
to be copied at Somerset-house. The Academy have then, at length,
fallen into the method pursued at the British Gallery, of recommending
the students to copy from the <span class='sc'>Old Masters</span>. Well—<em>better late
than never!</em> This same portrait is not, we think, the truest specimen
of Vandyke. It has not his mild, pensive, somewhat effeminate cast
of colour and expression. His best portraits have an air of faded
gentility about them. The Govarcius has too many streaks of blood-colour,
too many marks of the pencil, to convey an exact idea of
Vandyke’s characteristic excellence; though it is a fine imitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Rubens’s florid manner. Vandyke’s most striking portraits are those
which look just like a gentleman or lady seen in a looking-glass, and
neither more nor less.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the Claudes, we prefer the St. Ursula—the <cite>Embarking of the
Five thousand Virgins</cite>—to the others. The water is exquisite; and
the sails of the vessels glittering in the morning sun, and the blue
flags placed against the trees, which seem like an opening into the
sky behind—so sparkling is the effect of this ambiguity in colouring—are
in Claude’s most perfect manner. The Altieri Claude is one
of his noblest and most classical compositions, with towers, and trees,
and streams, and flocks, and herds, and distant sunny vales,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——‘Where universal Pan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,</div>
      <div class='line'>Leads on the eternal spring:—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>but the effect of the execution has been deadened and rendered flat
by time or ill-usage. There is a dull, formal appearance, as if the
different masses of sky, of water, &amp;c., were laid on with plates of tin
or lead. This is not a general defect in Claude: his landscapes have
the greatest quantity of inflection, the most delicate brilliancy, of all
others. A lady had been making a good copy of the <cite>Seaport</cite>, which
is a companion to the one we have described. We do not think
these Claudes, famous as they are, equal to Lord Egremont’s <cite>Jacob
and Laban</cite>; to the <cite>Enchanted Castle</cite>; to a green vernal Landscape,
which was in Walsh Porter’s Collection, and which was the very
finest we ever saw; nor to some others that have appeared from time
to time in the British Institution. We are sorry to make this, which
may be thought an ill-natured, remark: but, though we have a great
respect for Mr. Angerstein’s taste, we have a greater for Claude
Lorraine’s reputation. Let any persons admire these specimens of
his art as much as they will (and the more they admire them, the
more we shall be gratified), and then we will tell them, he could do
far finer things than these!</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one Rembrandt, and one N. Poussin. The Rembrandt
(the <cite>Woman taken in Adultery</cite>) is prodigious in colouring, in light and
shade, in pencilling, in solemn effect; but that is nearly all—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>‘Of outward show</div>
      <div class='line'>Elaborate, of inward less exact.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, it is worth any money. The Christ has considerable
seriousness and dignity of aspect. The marble pavement, of which
the light is even dazzling; the figures of the two Rabbis to the right,
radiant with crimson, green, and azure; the back-ground, which seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>like some rich oil-colour smeared over a ground of gold, and where
the eye staggers on from one abyss of obscurity to another,—place
this picture in the first rank of Rembrandt’s wonderful performances.
If this extraordinary genius was the most literal and vulgar of
draughtsmen, he was the most <em>ideal</em> of colourists. When Annibal
Caracci vowed to God, that Titian and Correggio were the only
true painters, he had not seen Rembrandt;—if he had, he would
have added him to the list. The Poussin is a <cite>Dance of Bacchanals</cite>:
theirs are not ‘pious orgies.’ It is, however, one of this master’s
finest pictures, both in the spirit of the execution, and the ingenuity
and <em>equivoque</em> of the invention. If the purity of the drawing will
make amends for the impurity of the design, it may pass: assuredly
the same subject, badly executed, would not be endured; but the
life of mind, the dexterity of combination displayed in it, supply
the want of decorum. The old adage, that ‘Vice, by losing all its
grossness, loses half its evil,’ seems chiefly applicable to pictures.
Thus a naked figure, that has nothing but its nakedness to recommend
it, is not fit to be hung up in decent apartments. If it is a Nymph
by Titian, Correggio’s Iö, we no longer think of its being naked;
but merely of its sweetness, its beauty, its naturalness. So far art,
as it is intellectual, has a refinement and extreme unction of its own.
Indifferent pictures, like dull people, must absolutely be moral! We
suggest this as a hint to those persons of more gallantry than discretion,
who think that to have an indecent daub hanging up in one corner of
the room, is proof of a liberality of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">gusto</span></i>, and a considerable progress
in <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span></i>. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout au contraire.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>We have a clear, brown, woody <cite>Landscape</cite> by Gaspar Poussin, in
his fine determined style of pencilling, which gives to earth its
solidity, and to the air its proper attributes. There are perhaps,
no landscapes that excel his in this fresh, healthy look of nature.
One might say, that wherever his pencil loves to haunt, ‘the air
is delicate.’ We forgot to notice a <cite>St. John in the Wilderness</cite>, by
A. Caracci, which has much of the autumnal tone, the ‘sear and
yellow leaf,’ of Titian’s landscape-compositions. A <cite>Rape of the
Sabines</cite>, in the inner room, by Rubens, is, we think, the most
tasteless picture in the Collection: to see plump, florid viragos
struggling with bearded ruffians, and tricked out in the flounces,
furbelows, and finery of the court of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> is preposterous.
But there is another Rubens in the outer room, which, though
fantastical and quaint, has qualities to redeem all faults. It is an
allegory of himself and his three wives, as a St. George and Holy
Family, with his children as Christ and St. John, playing with a
lamb; in which he has contrived to bring together all that is rich
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>in antique dresses, (black as jet, and shining like diamonds,) transparent
in flesh-colour, agreeable in landscape, unfettered in composition.
The light streams from rosy clouds; the breeze curls the
branches of the trees in the back-ground, and plays on the clear
complexions of the various scattered group. It is one of this painter’s
most splendid, and, at the same time, most solid and sharply finished
productions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Wilkie’s <cite>Alehouse Door</cite> is here, and deserves to be here.
Still it is not his best; though there are some very pleasing rustic
figures, and some touching passages in it. As in his <cite>Blind-Man’s-buff</cite>,
the groups are too straggling, and spread over too large a surface of
bare foreground, which Mr. Wilkie does not paint well. It looks
more like putty than earth or clay. The artist has a better eye
for the individual details, than for the general tone of objects.
Mr. Liston’s face in this ‘flock of drunkards’ is a smiling failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>A portrait of Hogarth, by himself, and Sir Joshua’s half-length of
Lord Heathfield, hang in the same room. The last of these is
certainly a fine picture, well composed, richly coloured, with
considerable character, and a look of nature. Nevertheless, our
artist’s pictures, seen among standard works, have (to speak it
plainly) something old-womanish about them. By their obsolete
and affected air, they remind one of antiquated ladies of quality, and
are a kind of Duchess-Dowagers in the art—somewhere between the
living and the dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hogarth’s series of the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> (the most delicately
painted of all his pictures, and admirably they certainly are painted)
concludes the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonnée</span></cite> of this Collection.—A study of
Heads, by Correggio, and some of Mr. Fuseli’s stupendous figures
from his Milton Gallery, are on the staircase.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on the 5th of November that we went to see this Gallery.

faint and watery, as if smiling his last; Winter gently let go the
hand of Summer, and the green fields, wet with the mist, anticipated
the return of Spring. At the end of a beautiful little village, Dulwich
College appeared in view, with modest state, yet mindful of the olden
time; and the name of Allen and his compeers rushed full upon the
memory! How many races of school-boys have played within its
walls, or stammered out a lesson, or sauntered away their vacant
hours in its shade: yet, not one Shakspeare is there to be found
among them all! The boy is clothed and fed and gets through
his accidence: but no trace of his youthful learning, any more than
of his saffron livery, is to be met with in the man. Genius is not to
be ‘constrained by mastery.’—Nothing comes of these endowments
and foundations for learning,—you might as well make dirt-pies, or
build houses with cards. Yet something <em>does</em> come of them too—a
retreat for age, a dream in youth—a feeling in the air around them,
the memory of the past, the hope of what will never be. Sweet are
the studies of the school-boy, delicious his idle hours! Fresh and
gladsome is his waking, balmy are his slumbers, book-pillowed! He
wears a green and yellow livery perhaps; but ‘green and yellow
melancholy’ comes not near him, or if it does, is tempered with
youth and innocence! To thumb his Eutropius, or to knuckle down
at taw, are to him equally delightful; for whatever stirs the blood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>or inspires thought in him, quickens the pulse of life and joy. He
has only to feel, in order to be happy; pain turns smiling from him,
and sorrow is only a softer kind of pleasure. Each sensation is but
an unfolding of his new being; care, age, sickness, are idle words;
the musty records of antiquity look glossy in his sparkling eye, and
he clasps immortality as his future bride! The coming years hurt
him not—he hears their sound afar off, and is glad. See him there,
the urchin, seated in the sun, with a book in his hand, and the wall
at his back. He has a thicker wall before him—the wall that parts
him from the future. He sees not the archers taking aim at his
peace; he knows not the hands that are to mangle his bosom. He
stirs not, he still pores upon his book, and, as he reads, a slight
hectic flush passes over his cheek, for he sees the letters that compose
the word <span class='sc'>Fame</span> glitter on the page, and his eyes swim, and he thinks
that he will one day write a book, and have his name repeated by
thousands of readers, and assume a certain signature, and write Essays
and Criticisms in a <span class='sc'>London Magazine</span>, as a consummation of felicity
scarcely to be believed. Come hither, thou poor little fellow, and
let us change places with thee if thou wilt; here, take the pen and
finish this article, and sign what name you please to it; so that we
may but change our dress for yours, and sit shivering in the sun,
and con over our little task, and feed poor, and lie hard, and be
contented and happy, and think what a fine thing it is to be an
author, and dream of immortality, and sleep o’nights!</p>

<p class='c000'>There is something affecting and monastic in the sight of this little
nursery of learning, simple and retired as it stands, just on the verge
of the metropolis, and in the midst of modern improvements. There
is a chapel, containing a copy of <cite>Raphael’s Transfiguration</cite>, by Julio
Romano: but the great attraction to curiosity at present is the
Collection of pictures left to the College by the late Sir Francis
Bourgeois, who is buried in a mausoleum close by. He once (it is
said) spent an agreeable day here in company with the Masters of
the College and some other friends; and he determined, in consequence,
upon this singular mode of testifying his gratitude and his
respect. Perhaps, also, some such idle thoughts as we have here
recorded might have mingled with this resolution. The contemplation
and the approach of death might have been softened to his mind
by being associated with the hopes of childhood; and he might wish
that his remains should repose, in monumental state, amidst ‘the
innocence and simplicity of poor <cite>Charity Boys</cite>!’ Might it not have
been so?</p>

<p class='c000'>The pictures are 356 in number, and are hung on the walls of
a large gallery, built for the purpose, and divided into five compartments.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>They certainly looked better in their old places, at the
house of Mr. Desenfans (the original collector), where they were
distributed into a number of small rooms, and seen separately and
close to the eye. They are mostly cabinet-pictures; and not only
does the height, at which many of them are necessarily hung to cover
a large space, lessen the effect, but the number distracts and deadens
the attention. Besides, the skylights are so contrived as to ‘shed a
dim,’ though not a ‘religious light’ upon them. At our entrance,
we were first struck by our old friends the Cuyps; and just beyond,
caught a glimpse of that fine female head by Carlo Maratti, giving us
a welcome with cordial glances. May we not exclaim—</p>

<p class='c000'>A fine gallery of pictures is a sort of illustration of Berkeley’s
Theory of Matter and Spirit. It is like a palace of thought—another
universe, built of air, of shadows, of colours. Every thing
seems ‘palpable to feeling as to sight.’ Substances turn to shadows
by the painter’s arch-chemic touch; shadows harden into substances.
‘The eye is made the fool of the other senses, or else worth all the
rest.’ The material is in some sense embodied in the immaterial,
or, at least, we see all things in a sort of intellectual mirror. The
world of art is an enchanting deception. We discover distance in
a glazed surface; a province is contained in a foot of canvass; a thin
evanescent tint gives the form and pressure of rocks and trees; an
inert shape has life and motion in it. Time stands still, and the
dead re-appear, by means of this ‘so potent art!’ Look at the
Cuyp next the door (No. 3). It is woven of etherial hues. A soft
mist is on it, a veil of subtle air. The tender green of the vallies
beyond the gleaming lake, the purple light of the hills, have an effect
like the down on an unripe nectarine. You may lay your finger on
the canvass; but miles of dewy vapour and sunshine are between you
and the objects you survey. It is almost needless to point out that
the cattle and figures in the fore-ground, like dark, transparent spots,
give an immense relief to the perspective. This is, we think, the
finest Cuyp, perhaps, in the world. The landscape opposite to it
(in the same room) by Albert Cuyp, has a richer colouring and
a stronger contrast of light and shade, but it has not that tender bloom
of a spring morning (so delicate, yet so powerful in its effect) which
the other possesses. <cite>Two Horses</cite>, by Cuyp (No. 74), is another
admirable specimen of this excellent painter. It is hard to say,
which is most true to nature—the sleek, well-fed look of the bay
horse, or the bone and spirit of the dappled iron-grey one, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>face of the man who is busy fastening a girth. Nature is scarcely
more faithful to itself, than this delightfully <em>unmannered</em>, unaffected
picture is to it. In the same room there are several good Tenierses,
and a small <cite>Head of an old Man</cite>, by Rembrandt, which is as smoothly
finished as a miniature. No. 10, <cite>Interior of an Ale-house</cite>, by Adrian
Brouwer, almost gives one a sick head-ache; particularly, the face
and figure of the man leaning against the door, overcome with
‘potations pottle deep.’ Brouwer united the depth and richness
of Ostade to the spirit and felicity of Teniers. No. 12, <cite>Sleeping
Nymph and Satyr</cite>, and 59, <cite>Nymph and Satyr</cite>, by Polemberg, are not
pictures to our taste. Why should any one make it a rule never to
paint any thing but this one subject? Was it to please himself or
others? The one shows bad taste, the other wrong judgment.
The grossness of the selection is hardly more offensive than the
finicalness of the execution. No. 49, a <cite>Mater Dolorosa</cite>, by Carlo
Dolce, is a very good specimen of this master; but the expression
has too great a mixture of piety and pauperism in it. It is not
altogether spiritual. No. 51, <cite>A School with Girls at work</cite>, by
Crespi, is a most rubbishly performance, and has the look of a
modern picture. It was, no doubt, painted in the fashion of the
time, and is now old-fashioned. Every thing has this modern, or
rather uncouth and obsolete look, which, besides the temporary and
local circumstances, has not the free look of nature. Dress a figure
in what costume you please (however fantastic, however barbarous),
but add the expression which is common to all faces, the properties
that are common to all drapery in its elementary principles, and the
picture will belong to all times and places. It is not the addition of
individual circumstances, but the omission of general truth, that makes
the little, the deformed, and the short-lived in art. No. 183, <cite>Religion
in the Desart</cite>, a sketch by Sir Francis Bourgeois, is a proof of this
remark. There are no details, nor is there any appearance of permanence
or sta[bility about it. It] seems to have been painted yesterday,
and to labour under premature decay. It has a look of being
half done, and you have no wish to see it finished. No. 53,
<cite>Interior of a Cathedral</cite>, by Sanadram, is curious and fine. From
one end of the perspective to the other—and back again—would
make a morning’s walk.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <span class='sc'>Second Room</span>, No. 90, a <cite>Sea Storm</cite>, by Backhuysen, and
No. 93, <cite>A Calm</cite>, by W. Vandervelde, are equally excellent, the one
for its gloomy turbulence, and the other for its glassy smoothness.
92, <cite>Landscape with Cattle and Figures</cite>, is by Both, who is, we
confess, no great favourite of ours. We do not like his straggling
branches of trees without masses of foliage, continually running up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>into the sky, merely to let in the landscape beyond. No. 96, <cite>Blowing
Hot and Cold</cite>, by Jordaens, is as fine a picture as need be painted.
It is full of character, of life, and pleasing colour. It is rich and
not gross. 98, <cite>Portrait of a Lady</cite>, said in the printed Catalogue to
be by Andrea Sacchi, is surely by Carlo Maratti, to whom it used to
be given. It has great beauty, great elegance, great expression, and
great brilliancy of execution; but every thing in it belongs to a more
polished style of art than Andrea Sacchi. Be this as it may, it is one
of the most perfect pictures in the collection. Of the portraits of
known individuals in this room, we wish to say but little, for we can
say nothing good. That of <cite>Mr. Kemble</cite>, by Beechey, is perhaps the
most direct and manly. In this room is Rubens’s <cite>Sampson and Delilah</cite>,
a coarse daub—at least, it looks so between two pictures by Vandyke,
<cite>Charity</cite>, and a <cite>Madonna and Infant Christ</cite>. That painter probably
never produced any thing more complete than these two compositions.
They have the softness of air, the solidity of marble: the pencil
appears to float and glide over the features of the face, the folds
of the drapery, with easy volubility, but to mark every thing with
a precision, a force, a grace indescribable. Truth seems to hold the
pencil, and elegance to guide it. The attitudes are exquisite, and the
expression all but divine. It is not like Raphael’s, it is true—but
whose else was? Vandyke was born in Holland, and lived most of his
time in England!—There are several capital pictures of horses, &amp;c. by
Wouvermans, in the same room, particularly the one with a hay-cart
loading on the top of a rising ground. The composition is as striking
and pleasing as the execution is delicate. There is immense knowledge
and character in Wouvermans’ horses—an ear, an eye turned round,
a cropped tail, give you their history and thoughts—but from the
want of a little arrangement, his figures look too often like spots on a
dark ground. When they are properly relieved and disentangled
from the rest of the composition, there is an appearance of great life
and bustle in his pictures. His horses, however, have too much of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manège</span></i> in them—he seldom gets beyond the camp or the riding
school.—This room is rich in master-pieces. Here is the <cite>Jacob’s
Dream</cite>, by Rembrandt, with that sleeping figure, thrown like a
bundle of clothes in one corner of the picture, by the side of some
stunted bushes, and with those winged shapes, not human, nor
angelical, but bird-like, dream-like, treading on clouds, ascending,
descending through the realms of endless light, that loses itself in
infinite space! No one else could ever grapple with this subject, or
stamp it on the willing canvass in its gorgeous obscurity but Rembrandt!
Here also is the <cite>St. Barbara</cite>, of Rubens, fleeing from her
persecutors; a noble design, as if she were scaling the steps of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>high overhanging turret, moving majestically on, with Fear before
her, Death behind her, and Martyrdom crowning her:—and here is
an eloquent landscape by the same master-hand, the subject of which
is, a shepherd piping his flock homewards through a narrow defile,
with a graceful group of autumnal trees waving on the edge of the
declivity above, and the rosy evening light streaming through the
clouds on the green moist landscape in the still lengthening distance.
Here (to pass from one kind of excellence to another with kindly
interchange) is a clear sparkling <cite>Waterfall</cite>, by Ruysdael, and
Hobbima’s <cite>Water-Mill</cite>, with the wheels in motion, and the ducks
paddling in the restless stream. Is not this a sad anti-climax from
Jacob’s Dream to a picture of a Water-Mill? We do not know;
and we should care as little, could we but paint either of the
pictures.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>If a picture is admirable in its kind, we do not give ourselves much
trouble about the subject. Could we paint as well as Hobbima, we
should not envy Rembrandt: nay, even as it is, while we can relish
both, we envy neither!</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Centre Room</span> commences with a <cite>Girl at a Window</cite>, by
Rembrandt. The picture is known by the print of it, and is one of
the most remarkable and pleasing in the Collection. For clearness,
for breadth, for a lively, ruddy look of healthy nature, it cannot be
surpassed. The execution of the drapery is masterly. There is a
story told of its being his servant-maid looking out of a window, but
it is evidently the portrait of a mere child.—<cite>A Farrier shoeing an Ass</cite>,
by Berchem, is in his usual manner. There is truth of character and
delicate finishing; but the fault of all Berchem’s pictures is, that he
continues to finish after he has done looking at nature, and his last
touches are different from hers. Hence comes that resemblance to
<em>tea-board</em> painting, which even his best works are chargeable with.
We find here one or two small Claudes of no great value; and two
very clever specimens of the court-painter, Watteau, the Gainsborough
of France. They are marked as Nos. 184 and 194, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fête Champêtre</span></cite>,
and <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Bal Champêtre</span></cite>. There is something exceedingly light, agreeable,
and characteristic in this artist’s productions. He might almost
be said to breathe his figures and his flowers on the canvas—so fragile
is their texture, so evanescent is his touch. He unites the court and
the country at a sort of salient point—you may fancy yourself with
Count Grammont and the beauties of Charles II. in their gay retreat
at Tunbridge Wells. His trees have a drawing-room air with them,
an appearance of gentility and etiquette, and nod gracefully over-head;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>while the figures below, thin as air, and <em>vegetably</em> clad, in the midst
of all their affectation and grimace, seem to have just sprung out of
the ground, or to be the fairy inhabitants of the scene in masquerade.
They are the Oreads and Dryads of the Luxembourg! Quaint
association, happily effected by the pencil of Watteau! In the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bal
Champêtre</span></cite> we see Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> himself dancing, looking so like an old
beau, his face flushed and puckered up with gay anxiety; but then
the satin of his slashed doublet is made of the softest leaves of the
water-lily; Zephyr plays wanton with the curls of his wig! We
have nobody who could produce a companion to this picture now:
nor do we very devoutly wish it. The Louis the Fourteenths are
extinct, and we suspect their revival would hardly be compensated
even by the re-appearance of a Watteau.—No. 187, <em>the Death of
Cardinal Beaufort</em>, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, is a very indifferent and
rather unpleasant sketch of a very fine picture. One of the most
delightful things in this delightful collection is <em>the Portrait (195) of
the Prince of the Austurias</em>, by Velasquez. The easy lightness of the
childish Prince contrasts delightfully with the unwieldy figure of
the horse, which has evidently been brought all the way from the
Low Countries for the amusement of his rider. Velasquez was
(with only two exceptions, Titian and Vandyke) as fine a portrait-painter
as ever lived! In the centre room also is the <cite>Meeting of
Jacob and Rachel</cite>, by Murillo—a sweet picture with a fresh green
landscape, and the heart of Love in the midst of it.—There are
several heads by Holbein scattered up and down the different compartments.
We need hardly observe that they all have character in
the extreme, so that we may be said to be acquainted with the people
they represent; but then they give nothing but character, and only one
part of that, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> the dry, the literal, the concrete, and fixed. They
want the addition of passion and beauty; but they are the finest <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput
mortuums</span></i> of expression that ever were made. Hans Holbein had
none of the volatile essence of genius in his composition. If
portrait-painting is the prose of the art, his pictures are the prose
of portrait-painting. Yet he is ‘a reverend name’ in art, and one of
the benefactors of the human mind. He has left faces behind him
that we would give the world to have seen, and there they are—stamped
on his canvass for ever! Who, in reading over the names
of certain individuals, does not feel a yearning in his breast to know
their features and their lineaments? We look through a small frame,
and lo! at the distance of three centuries, we have before us the
figures of Anne Boleyn, of the virtuous Cranmer, the bigoted Queen
Mary, the noble Surrey—as if we had seen them in their life-time,
not perhaps in their best moods or happiest attitudes, but as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>sometimes appeared, no doubt. We know at least what sort of looking
people they were: our minds are made easy on that score; the ‘body
and limbs’ are there, and we may ‘add what flourishes’ of grace or
ornament we please. Holbein’s heads are to the finest portraits what
state-papers are to history.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first picture in the <span class='sc'>Fourth Room</span> is the <cite>Prophet Samuel</cite>, by
Sir Joshua. It is not the Prophet Samuel, but a very charming
picture of a little child saying its prayers. The second is, <cite>The
Education of Bacchus</cite>, by Nicholas Poussin. This picture makes one
thirsty to look at it—the colouring even is dry and adust. It is true
<em>history</em> in the technical phrase, that is to say, true <em>poetry</em> in the vulgate.
The figure of the infant Bacchus seems as if he would drink up a
vintage—he drinks with his mouth, his hands, his belly, and his
whole body. Gargantua was nothing to him. In the <cite>Education of
Jupiter</cite>, in like manner, we are thrown back into the infancy of
mythologic lore. The little Jupiter, suckled by a she-goat, is
beautifully conceived and expressed; and the dignity and ascendancy
given to these animals in the picture is wonderfully happy. They
have a very imposing air of gravity indeed, and seem to be by prescription
‘grand caterers and wet-nurses of the state’ of Heaven!
<cite>Apollo giving a Poet a Cup of Water to drink</cite> is elegant and classical;
and <cite>The Flight into Egypt</cite> instantly takes the tone of Scripture-history.
This is strange, but so it is. All things are possible to a high
imagination. All things, about which we have a feeling, may be
expressed by true genius. A dark landscape (by the same hand) in
a corner of the room is a proof of this. There are trees in the fore-ground,
with a paved road and buildings in the distance. The
Genius of antiquity might wander here, and feel itself at home.—The
large leaves are wet and heavy with dew, and the eye dwells
‘under the shade of melancholy boughs.’ In the old collection (in
Mr. Desenfans’ time) the Poussins occupied a separated room by
themselves, and it was (we confess) a very favourite room with us.—No.
226, is a <cite>Landscape</cite>, by Salvator Rosa. It is one of his very
best—rough, grotesque, wild—Pan has struck it with his hoof—the
trees, the rocks, the fore-ground, are of a piece, and the figures are
subordinate to the landscape. The same dull sky lowers upon the
scene, and the bleak air chills the crisp surface of the water. It is
a consolation to us to meet with a fine Salvator. His is one of the
great names in art, and it is among our sources of regret that we
cannot always admire his works as we would do, from our respect to
his reputation and our love of the man. Poor Salvator! he was
unhappy in his life-time; and it vexes us to think that we cannot
make him amends by fancying him so great a painter as some others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>whose fame was not their only inheritance!—227, <cite>Venus and Cupid</cite>,
is a delightful copy after Correggio. We have no such regrets or
qualms of conscience with respect to him. ‘He has had his reward.’
The weight of his renown balances the weight of barbarous coin that
sunk him to the earth. Could he live now, and know what others
think of him, his misfortunes would seem as dross compared with his
lasting glory, and his heart would melt within him at the thought,
with a sweetness that only his own pencil could express. 233, <cite>The
Virgin, Infant Christ, and St. John</cite>, by Andrea del Sarto, is exceedingly
good.—290, Another <cite>Holy Family</cite>, by the same, is an admirable
picture, and only inferior to Raphael. It has delicacy, force,
thought, and feeling. ‘What lacks it then,’ to be equal to Raphael?
We hardly know, unless it be a certain firmness and freedom, and
glowing animation. The execution is more timid and laboured. It
looks like a picture (an exquisite one, indeed), but Raphael’s look
like the divine reality itself!—No. 234, <cite>Cocles defending the Bridge</cite>,
is by Le Brun. We do not like this picture, nor 271, <cite>The Massacre
of the Innocents</cite>, by the same artist. One reason is that they are
French, and another that they are not good. They have great
merit, it is true, but their merits are only splendid sins. They
are mechanical, mannered, colourless, and unfeeling.—No. 237, is
Murillo’s <cite>Spanish Girl with Flowers</cite>. The sun tinted the young
gipsey’s complexion, and not the painter.—No. 240, is <cite>The Casatella
and Villa of Mæcenas, near Tivoli</cite>, by Wilson, with his own portrait
in the fore-ground. It is an imperfect sketch; but there is a curious
anecdote relating to it, that he was so delighted with the waterfall
itself, that he cried out, while painting it: ‘Well done, water, by
G—d!’—No. 243, <cite>Saint Cecilia</cite>, by Guercino, is a very pleasing
picture, in his least gaudy manner.—No. 251, <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>, by
Titian. We see so many of these Venuses and Adonises, that we
should like to know which is the true one. This is one of the best
we have seen. We have two Francesco Molas in this room, the
<cite>Rape of Proserpine</cite>, and a <cite>Landscape with a Holy Family</cite>. This
artist dipped his pencil so thoroughly in Titian’s palette, that his
works cannot fail to have that rich, mellow look, which is always
delightful.—No. 303, <cite>Portrait of Philip the Fourth of Spain</cite>, by
Velasquez, is purity and truth itself. We used to like the <cite>Sleeping
Nymph</cite>, by Titian, when we saw it formerly in the little entrance-room
at Desenfans’, but we cannot say much in its praise here.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Fifth Room</span> is the smallest, but the most precious in its
contents.—No. 322, <cite>Spanish Beggar Boys</cite>, by Murillo, is the
triumph of this Collection, and almost of painting. In the imitation
of common life, nothing ever went beyond it, or as far as we can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>judge, came up to it. A Dutch picture is mechanical, and mere
<em>still-life</em> to it. But this is life itself. The boy at play on the ground
is miraculous. It is done with a few dragging strokes of the pencil,
and with a little tinge of colour; but the mouth, the nose, the eyes,
the chin, are as brimful as they can hold of expression, of arch
roguery, of animal spirits, of vigorous, elastic health. The vivid,
glowing, cheerful look is such as could only be found beneath a
southern sun. The fens and dykes of Holland (with all our respect
for them) could never produce such an epitome of the vital principle.
The other boy, standing up with the pitcher in his hand, and a crust
of bread in his mouth, is scarcely less excellent. His sulky,
phlegmatic indifference speaks for itself. The companion to this
picture, 324, is also very fine. Compared with these imitations of
nature, as faultless as they are spirited, Murillo’s Virgins and Angels
however good in themselves, look vapid, and even vulgar. A <cite>Child
Sleeping</cite>, by the same painter, is a beautiful and masterly study.—No.
329, a <cite>Musical Party</cite>, by Giorgione, is well worthy of the notice
of the connoisseur. No. 331, <cite>St. John Preaching in the Wilderness</cite>,
by Guido, is an extraordinary picture, and very unlike this painter’s
usual manner. The colour is as if the flesh had been stained all over
with brick-dust. There is, however, a wildness about it which
accords well with the subject, and the figure of St. John is full of
grace and gusto.—No. 344, <cite>The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian</cite>, by the
same, is much finer, both as to execution and expression. The face
is imbued with deep passion.—No. 345, <cite>Portrait of a Man</cite>, by L. da
Vinci, is truly simple and grand, and at once carries you back to that
age.—<cite>Boors Merry Making</cite>, by Ostade, is fine; but has no business
where it is. Yet it takes up very little room.—No. 347, <cite>Portrait of
Mrs. Siddons, in the character of the Tragic Muse</cite>, by Sir Joshua,
appears to us to resemble neither Mrs. Siddons, nor the Tragic Muse.
It is in a bastard style of art. Sir Joshua had an importunate theory
of improving upon nature. He might improve upon indifferent
nature, but when he had got the finest, he thought to improve upon
that too, and only spoiled it.—No. 349, <cite>The Virgin and Child</cite>, by
Correggio, can only be a copy.—No. 332, <cite>The Judgment of Paris</cite>,
by Vanderwerf, is a picture, and by a master, that we hate. He
always chooses for his subjects naked figures of women, and tantalises
us by making them of coloured ivory. They are like hard-ware toys.—No.
354, <cite>a Cardinal Blessing a Priest</cite>, by P. Veronese, is dignified
and picturesque in the highest degree.—No. 355, <cite>The Adoration of
the Shepherds</cite>, by Annibal Caracci, is an elaborate, but not very
successful performance.—No. 356, <cite>Christ bearing his Cross</cite>, by
Morales, concludes the list, and is worthy to conclude it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our intercourse with the dead is better than our intercourse with
the living. There are only three pleasures in life, pure and lasting,
and all derived from inanimate things—books, pictures, and the face
of nature. What is the world but a heap of ruined friendships, but
the grave of love? All other pleasures are as false and hollow,
vanishing from our embrace like smoke, or like a feverish dream.
Scarcely can we recollect that they were, or recall without an effort
the anxious and momentary interest we took in them.—But thou,
oh! divine <cite>Bath of Diana</cite>, with deep azure eyes, with roseate hues,
spread by the hand of Titian, art still there upon the wall, another,
yet the same that thou wert five-and-twenty years ago, nor wantest</p>

      <div class='line'>And mock our eyes with air!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And lo! over the clear lone brow of Tuderley and Norman Court,
knit into the web and fibres of our heart, the sighing grove waves in
the autumnal air, deserted by Love, by Hope, but forever haunted by
Memory! And there that fine passage stands in Antony and
Cleopatra as we read it long ago with exalting eyes in Paris, after
puzzling over a tragedy of Racine’s, and cried aloud: ‘Our Shakspeare
was also a poet!’ These feelings are dear to us at the time;
and they come back unimpaired, heightened, mellowed, whenever we
choose to go back to them. We turn over the leaf and ‘volume of
the brain,’ and there see them face to face.—Marina in Pericles

      <div class='line'>‘Life is as a storm hurrying her from her friends!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Not so from the friends above-mentioned. If we bring but an eye,
an understanding, and a heart to them, we find them always with us,
always the same. The change, if there is one, is in us, not in them.
Oh! thou then, whoever thou art, that dost seek happiness in thyself,
independent on others, not subject to caprice, not mocked by insult,
not snatched away by ruthless hands, over which Time has no power,
and that Death alone cancels, seek it (if thou art wise) in books, in
pictures, and the face of nature, for these alone we may count upon
as friends for life! While we are true to ourselves, they will not be
faithless to us. While we remember any thing, we cannot forget
them. As long as we have a wish for pleasure, we may find it here;
for it depends only on our love for them, and not on theirs for us.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The enjoyment is purely <em>ideal</em>, and is refined, unembittered, unfading,
for that reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>A complaint has been made of the short-lived duration of works
of art, and particularly of pictures; and poets more especially are apt
to lament and to indulge in an elegiac strain over the fragile beauties
of the sister-art. The complaint is inconsiderate, if not invidious.
<em>They will last our time.</em> Nay, they have lasted centuries before us,
and will last centuries after us; and even when they are no more,
will leave a shadow and a cloud of glory behind them, through all
time. Lord Bacon exclaims triumphantly, ‘Have not the poems of
Homer lasted five-and-twenty hundred years, and not a syllable of
them is lost?’ But it might be asked in return, ‘Have not many
of the Greek statues now lasted almost as long, without losing a
particle of their splendour or their meaning, while the Iliad (except
to a very few) has become almost a dead letter?’ Has not the
Venus of Medicis had almost as many partisans and admirers as the
Helen of the old blind bard? Besides, what has Phidias gained in
reputation even by the discovery of the Elgin Marbles? Or is not
Michael Angelo’s the greatest name in modern art, whose works we
only know from description and by report? Surely, there is something
in a name, in wide-spread reputation, in endless renown, to
satisfy the ambition of the mind of man. Who in his works would
vie immortality with nature? An epitaph, an everlasting monument
in the dim remembrance of ages, is enough below the skies. Moreover,
the sense of final inevitable decay <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">humanises</span></i>, and gives an
affecting character to the triumphs of exalted art. Imperishable
works executed by perishable hands are a sort of insult to our nature,
and almost a contradiction in terms. They are ungrateful children,
and mock the makers. Neither is the noble idea of antiquity legibly
made out without the marks of the progress and lapse of time. That
which is as good now as ever it was, seems a thing of yesterday.
Nothing is old to the imagination that does not appear to grow old.
Ruins are grander and more venerable than any modern structure can
be, or than the oldest could be if kept in the most entire preservation.
They convey the perspective of time. So the Elgin Marbles are
more impressive from their mouldering, imperfect state. They transport
us to the Parthenon, and old Greece. The Theseus is of the
age of Theseus: while the Apollo Belvidere is a modern fine gentleman;
and we think of this last figure only as an ornament to the
room where it happens to be placed.—We conceive that those are
persons of narrow minds who cannot relish an author’s style that
smacks of time, that has a crust of antiquity over it, like that which
gathers upon old wine. These sprinklings of <em>archaisms</em> and obsolete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>turns of expression (so abhorrent to the fashionable reader) are
intellectual links that connect the generations together, and enlarge
our knowledge of language and of nature. Of the two, we prefer
<em>black-letter</em> to hot-pressed paper. Does not every language change
and wear out? Do not the most popular writers become quaint and
old-fashioned every fifty or every hundred years? Is there not a
constant conflict of taste and opinion between those who adhere to
the established and triter modes of expression, and those who affect
glossy innovations, in advance of the age? It is pride enough for the
best authors <em>to have been read</em>. This applies to their own country;
and to all others, they are ‘a book sealed.’ But Rubens is as good
in Holland as he is in Flanders, where he was born, in Italy or in
Spain, in England, or in Scotland—no, there alone he is <em>not</em> understood.
The Scotch understand nothing but what is Scotch. What
has the dry, husky, economic eye of Scotland to do with the florid
hues and luxuriant extravagance of Rubens? Nothing. They like
Wilkie’s <em>pauper</em> style better. It may be said that translations remedy
the want of universality of language: but prints give (at least) as
good an idea of pictures as translations do of poems, or of any productions
of the press that employ the colouring of style and imagination.
Gil Blas is translateable; Racine and Rousseau are not. The
mere English student knows more of the character and spirit of
Raphael’s pictures in the Vatican, than he does of Ariosto or Tasso
from Hoole’s Version. There is, however, one exception to the
catholic language of painting, which is in French pictures. They
are national fixtures, and ought never to be removed from the soil in
which they grow. They will not answer any where else, nor are
they worth Custom-House Duties. Flemish, Dutch, Spanish, Italian,
are all good and intelligible in their several ways—we know what
they mean—they require no interpreter: but the French painters see
nature with organs and with minds peculiarly their own. One must
be born in France to understand their painting, or their poetry.
Their productions in art are either literal, or extravagant—dry, frigid
<em>fac-similes</em>, in which they seem to take up nature by pin-points, or else
vapid distorted caricatures, out of all rule and compass. They are,
in fact, at home only in the light and elegant; and whenever they
attempt to add force or solidity (as they must do in the severer productions
of the pencil) they are compelled to substitute an excess of
minute industry for a comprehension of the whole, or make a desperate
mechanical effort at extreme expression, instead of giving the true,
natural, and powerful workings of passion. Their representations of
nature are meagre skeletons, that bear the same relation to the originals
that botanical specimens, enclosed in a portfolio, flat, dry, hard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and pithless, do to flourishing plants and shrubs. Their historical
figures are painful outlines, or graduated elevations of the common
statues, spiritless, colourless, motionless, which have the form, but
none of the power of the <em>antique</em>. What an abortive attempt is the
<cite>Coronation of Napoleon</cite>, by the celebrated David, lately exhibited in
this country! It looks like a finished sign-post painting—a sea of
frozen outlines.—Could the artist make nothing of ‘the foremost man
in all this world,’ but a stiff, upright figure? The figure and attitude
of the Empress are, however, pretty and graceful; and we recollect
one face in profile, of an ecclesiastic, to the right, with a sanguine
look of health in the complexion, and a large benevolence of soul.
It is not Monsieur Talleyrand, whom the late Lord Castlereagh
characterised as a worthy man and his friend. His Lordship was
not a physiognomist! The whole of the shadowed part of the
picture seems to be enveloped in a shower of blue powder.—But to
make amends for all that there is or that there is not in the work,
David has introduced his wife and his two daughters; and in the
Catalogue has given us the places of abode, and the names of the
husbands of the latter. This is a little out of place: yet these are
the people who laugh at our blunders. We do not mean to extend
the above sweeping censure to Claude, or Poussin: of course they
are excepted: but even in them the national character lurked amidst
unrivalled excellence. If Claude has a fault, it is that he is finical;
and Poussin’s figures might be said by a satirist to be antique puppets.
To proceed to our task.—</p>

<p class='c000'>The first picture that struck us on entering the Marquis of
Stafford’s Gallery (a little bewildered as we were with old recollections,
and present objects) was the <cite>Meeting of Christ and St. John</cite>,
one of Raphael’s master-pieces. The eager ‘child-worship’ of the
young St. John, the modest retirement and dignified sweetness of
the Christ, and the graceful, matron-like air of the Virgin bending
over them, full and noble, yet feminine and elegant, cannot be surpassed.
No words can describe them to those who have not seen
the picture:—the attempt is still vainer to those who have. There
is, however, a very fine engraving of this picture, which may be had
for a trifling sum.—No glory is around the head of the Mother, nor
is it needed: but the soul of the painter sheds its influence over it
like a dove, and the spirit of love, sanctity, beauty, breathes from the
divine group. There are four Raphaels (Holy Families) in this
collection, two others by the side of this in his early more precise and
affected manner, somewhat faded, and a small one of the <cite>Virgin,
Sleeping Jesus, and St. John</cite>, in his finest manner. There is, or there
was, a duplicate of this picture (of which the engraving is also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>common) in the Louvre, which was certainly superior to the one at
the Marquis of Stafford’s. The colouring of the drapery in that too
was cold, and the face of the Virgin thin and poor; but never was
infancy laid asleep more calmly, more sweetly, more soundly, than in
the figure of Our Saviour—the little pouting mouth seemed to drink
balmy, innocent sleep—and the rude expression of wonder and delight
in the more robust, sun-burnt, fur-clad figure of St. John was as
spirited in itself as it was striking, when contrasted with the meeker
beauties of the figure opposed to it.—From these we turn to the
Four Ages, by Titian, or Giorgione, as some say. Strange that
there should have lived two men in the same age, on the same spot of
earth, with respect to whom it should bear a question—which of
them painted such a picture! Barry, we remember, and Collins, the
miniature-painter, thought it a Giorgione, and they were considered
two of the best judges <em>going</em>, at the time this picture was exhibited,
among others, in the Orleans Gallery. We cannot pretend to decide
on such nice matters <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedra</span></i>; but no painter need be ashamed to
own it. The gradations of human life are marked with characteristic
felicity, and the landscape, which is thrown in, adds a pastoral charm
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> to the whole. To live or to die in such a chosen, still
retreat must be happy!—Certainly, this composition suggests a beautiful
moral lesson; and as to the painting of the group of children in
the corner, we suppose, for careless freedom of pencil, and a certain
milky softness of the flesh, it can scarcely be paralleled. Over the
three Raphaels is a <cite>Danae</cite>, by Annibal Caracci, which we used to
adore where it was hung on high in the Orleans Gallery. The face
is fine, upturned, expectant; and the figure no less fine, desirable,
ample, worthy of a God.—The golden shower is just seen descending;
the landscape at a distance has (so fancy might interpret) a
cold, shuddering aspect. There is another very fine picture of the
same hand close by, <cite>St. Gregory with Angels</cite>. It is difficult to know
which to admire most, the resigned and yet earnest expression of the
Saint, or the elegant forms, the graceful attitudes, and bland, cordial,
benignant faces of the attendant angels. The artist in these last has
evidently had an eye to Correggio, both in the waving outline, and in
the charm of the expression; and he has succeeded admirably, but
not entirely. Something of the extreme unction of Correggio is
wanting. The drawing of Annibal’s Angels is, perhaps, too firm,
too sinewy, too masculine. In Correggio, the Angel’s spirit seemed
to be united to a human body, to imbue, mould, penetrate every part
with its sweetness and softness: in Caracci, you would say that a
heavenly spirit inhabited, looked out of, moved a goodly human frame,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And o’er-informed the tenement of clay.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The composition of this picture is rather forced (it was one of
those <em>made to order</em> for the monks) and the colour is somewhat
metallic; but it has, notwithstanding, on the whole, a striking and
tolerably harmonious effect.—There is still another picture by Caracci
(also an old favourite with us, for it was in the Orleans set) <cite>Diana
and Nymphs bathing</cite>, with the story of Calisto. It is one of his very
best, with something of the drawing of the antique, and the landscape-colouring
of Titian. The figures are all heroic, handsome, such as
might belong to huntresses, or Goddesses: and the coolness and
seclusion of the scene, under grey over-hanging cliffs, and brown
overshadowing trees, with all the richness and truth of nature, have
the effect of an enchanting reality.—The story and figures are more
classical and better managed than those of the <cite>Diana and Calisto</cite> by
Titian; but there is a charm in that picture and the fellow to it, the
<cite>Diana and Actæon</cite>, (there is no other fellow to it in the world!)
which no words can convey. It is the charm thrown over each by
the greatest genius for colouring that the world ever saw. It is
difficult, nay, impossible to say which is the finest in this respect:
but either one or the other (whichever we turn to, and we can never
be satisfied with looking at either—so rich a scene do they unfold, so
serene a harmony do they infuse into the soul) is like a divine piece
of music, or rises ‘like an exhalation of rich distilled perfumes.’ In
the figures, in the landscape, in the water, in the sky, there are tones,
colours, scattered with a profuse and unerring hand, gorgeous, but
most true, dazzling with their force, but blended, softened, woven
together into a woof like that of Iris—tints of flesh colour, as if you
saw the blood circling beneath the pearly skin; clouds empurpled
with setting suns; hills steeped in azure skies; trees turning to a
mellow brown; the cold grey rocks, and the water so translucent,
that you see the shadows and the snowy feet of the naked nymphs in
it. With all this prodigality of genius, there is the greatest severity
and discipline of art. The figures seem grouped for the effect of
colour—the most striking contrasts are struck out, and then a third
object, a piece of drapery, an uplifted arm, a bow and arrows, a
straggling weed, is introduced to make an intermediate tint, or carry
on the harmony. Every colour is melted, <em>impasted</em> into every other,
with fine keeping and bold diversity. Look at that indignant, queen-like
figure of Diana (more perhaps like an offended mortal princess,
than an immortal Goddess, though the immortals could frown and
give themselves strange airs), and see the snowy, ermine-like skin;
the pale clear shadows of the delicately formed back; then the brown
colour of the slender trees behind to set off the shaded flesh; and last,
the dark figure of the Ethiopian girl behind, completing the gradation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Then the bright scarf suspended in the air connects itself with the
glowing clouds, and deepens the solemn azure of the sky: Actæon’s
bow and arrows fallen on the ground are also red; and there is a
little flower on the brink of the Bath which catches and pleases the
eye, saturated with this colour. The yellowish grey of the earth
purifies the low tone of the figures where they are in half-shadow;
and this again is enlivened by the leaden-coloured fountain of the
Bath, which is set off (or kept down in its proper place) by the blue
vestments strown near it. The figure of Actæon is spirited and
natural; it is that of a bold rough hunter in the early ages, struck
with surprise, abashed with beauty. The forms of some of the
female figures are elegant enough, particularly that of Diana in the
story of Calisto; and there is a very pretty-faced girl mischievously
dragging the culprit forward; but it is the texture of the flesh that is
throughout delicious, unrivalled, surpassingly fair. The landscape
canopies the living scene with a sort of proud, disdainful consciousness.
The trees nod to it, and the hills roll at a distance in a sea of
colour. Every where tone, not form, predominates—there is not a
distinct line in the picture—but a gusto, a rich taste of colour is left
upon the eye as if it were the palate, and the diapason of picturesque
harmony is full to overflowing. ‘Oh Titian and Nature! which of
you copied the other?’</p>

<p class='c000'>We are ashamed of this description, now that we have made it,
and heartily wish somebody would make a better. There is another
Titian here (which was also in the Orleans Gallery),<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> <cite>Venus rising
from the sea</cite>. The figure and face are gracefully designed and sweetly
expressed:—whether it is the picture of the Goddess of Love, may
admit of a question; that it is the picture of a lovely woman in a
lovely attitude, admits of none. The half-shadow in which most of
it is painted, is a kind of veil through which the delicate skin shows
more transparent and aerial. There is nothing in the picture but this
single exquisitely turned figure, and if it were continued downward
to a whole-length, it would seem like a copy of a statue of the Goddess
carved in ivory or marble; but being only a half-length, it has not
this effect at all, but looks like an enchanting study, or a part of a
larger composition, selected <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a l’envie</span></i>. The hair, and the arm holding
it up, are nearly the same as in the well-known picture of <cite>Titian’s
Mistress</cite>, and as delicious. The back-ground is beautifully painted.
We said before, that there was no object in the picture detached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>from the principal figure. Nay, there is the sea, and a sea-shell, but
these might be given in sculpture.—Under the <cite>Venus</cite>, is a portrait by
Vandyke, of Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, a most gentleman-like
performance, mild, clear, intelligent, unassuming; and on the
right of the spectator, a <cite>Madonna</cite>, by Guido, with the icy glow of
sanctity upon it; and to the left, the <cite>Fable of Salmacis</cite>, by Albano
(saving the ambiguity of the subject), exquisitely painted. Four
finer specimens of the art can scarcely be found again in so small a
compass. There is in another room a portrait, said to be by Moroni,
and called <span class='sc'>Titian’s School-master</span>, from a vague tradition, that he
was in the habit of frequently visiting, in order to study and learn
from it. If so, he must have profited by his assiduity; for it looks
as if he had painted it. Not knowing any thing of Moroni, if we
had been asked who had done it, we should have replied, ‘<cite>Either
Titian or the Devil</cite>.’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a> It is considerably more laboured and minute
than Titian; but the only objection at all staggering is, that it has
less fiery animation than is ordinarily to be found in his pictures.
Look at the portrait above it, for instance—Clement <span class='fss'>VII.</span> by the great
Venetian; and you find the eye looking at you again, as if it had
been observing you all the time: but the eye in <cite>Titian’s School-master</cite>
is <em>an eye to look at, not to look with</em>,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a> or if it looks <em>at</em> you, it does not
look <em>through</em> you, which may be almost made a test of Titian’s heads.
There is not the spirit, the intelligence within, moulding the expression,
and giving it intensity of purpose and decision of character. In
every other respect but this (and perhaps a certain want of breadth)
it is as good as Titian. There is (we understand) a half-length of
Clement <span class='fss'>VII.</span> by Julio Romano, in the Papal Palace at Rome, in
which he is represented as seated above the spectator, with the head
elevated and the eye looking down like a camel’s, with an amazing
dignity of aspect. The picture (Mr. Northcote says) is hard and
ill-coloured, but, in strength of character and conception, superior to
the Titian at the Marquis of Stafford’s. Titian, undoubtedly, put a
good deal of his own character into his portraits. He was not himself
filled with the ‘milk of human kindness.’ He got his brother,
who promised to rival him in his own art, and of whom he was
jealous, sent on a foreign embassy; and he so frightened Pordenone
while he was painting an altar-piece for a church, that he worked
with his palette and brushes in his hand, and a sword by his side.</p>

<p class='c000'>We meet with one or two admirable portraits, particularly No. 112,
by Tintoretto, which is of a fine fleshy tone, and <cite>A Doge of Venice</cite>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>by Palma Vecchio, stamped with an expressive look of official and
assumed dignity. There is a Bassan, No. 95, <cite>The Circumcision</cite>, the
colours of which are somewhat dingy with age, and sunk into the
canvas; but as the sun shone upon it while we were looking at it, it
glittered all green and gold. Bassan’s execution is as fine as possible,
and his colouring has a most striking harmonious effect.—We must
not forget the <cite>Muleteers</cite>, supposed to be by Correggio, in which the
figure of the Mule seems actually passing across the picture (you hear
his bells); nor the little copy of his <cite>Marriage of St. Catherine</cite>, by
L. Caracci, which is all over grace, delicacy, and sweetness. Any
one may judge of his progress in a taste for the refinements of art, by
his liking for this picture. Indeed, Correggio is the very essence of
refinement. Among other pictures in the Italian division of the
gallery, we would point out the Claudes (particularly Nos. 43 and
50,) which, though inferior to Mr. Angerstein’s as compositions,
preserve more of the delicacy of execution, (or what Barry used to
call ‘<em>the fine oleaginous touches of Claude</em>‘)—two small Gaspar
Poussins, in which the landscape seems to have been just washed by
a shower, and the storm blown over—the <cite>Death of Adonis</cite>, by Luca
Cambiasi, an Orleans picture, lovely in sorrow, and in speechless
agony, and faded like the life that is just expiring in it—a <cite>Joseph and
Potiphar’s Wife</cite>, by Alessandro Veronese, a very clever, and sensible,
but rigidly painted picture<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a>—an Albert Durer, the <cite>Death of the
Virgin</cite>—a <cite>Female head</cite>, by Leonardo da Vinci—and <em>the Woman taken
in Adultery</em>, by Pordenone, which last the reader may admire or not,
as he pleases. We cannot close this list without referring to the
<cite>Christ bearing his cross</cite>, by Domenichino, a picture full of interest
and skill; and the little touching allegory of the <cite>Infant Christ
sleeping on a cross</cite>, by Guido.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch School contains a number of excellent specimens of
the best masters. There are two Tenierses, a <cite>Fair</cite>, and <cite>Boors
merry-making</cite>, unrivalled for a look of the open air, for lively awkward
gesture, and variety and grotesqueness of grouping and rustic
character. There is a little picture, by Le Nain, called the <cite>Village
Minstrel</cite>, with a set of youthful auditors, the most incorrigible little
mischievous urchins we ever saw, but with admirable execution and
expression. The Metzus are curious and fine—the Ostades admirable.
Gerard Douw’s own portrait is certainly a gem. We noticed
a Ruysdael in one corner of the room (No. 221), a dark, flat,
wooded country, but delectable in tone and pencilling. Vandevelde’s
Sea-pieces are capital—the water is smooth as glass, and the boats
and vessels have the buoyancy of butterflies on it. The <cite>Seaport</cite>, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>A. Cuyp, is miraculous for truth, brilliancy, and clearness, almost
beyond actual water. These cannot be passed over; but there is a
little picture which we beg to commend to the gentle reader, the
Vangoyen, at the end of the room, No. 156, which has that yellow-tawny
colour in the meads, and that grey chill look in the old
convent, that give one the precise feeling of a mild day towards the
end of winter, in a humid, marshy country. We many years ago
copied a Vangoyen, a view of a Canal ‘with yellow tufted banks and
gliding sail,’ modestly pencilled, truly felt—and have had an affection
for him ever since. There is a small inner room with some most
respectable modern pictures. Wilkie’s <cite>Breakfast-table</cite> is among
them.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Sacraments</cite>, by N. Poussin, occupy a separate room by themselves,
and have a grand and solemn effect; but we could hardly see
them where they are; and in general, we prefer his treatment of
light and classical subjects to those of sacred history. He wanted
<em>weight</em> for the last; or, if that word is objected to, we will change
it, and say <em>force</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the whole, the Stafford Gallery is probably the most magnificent
Collection this country can boast. The specimens of the
different schools are as numerous as they are select; and they are
equally calculated to delight the student by the degree, or to inform
the uninitiated by the variety of excellence. Yet even this Collection
is not complete. It is deficient in Rembrandts, Vandykes, and

<p class='c008'>The palaces of Windsor and Hampton-court contain pictures
worthy of the feelings we attach to the names of those places. The
first boasts a number of individual pictures of great excellence and
interest, and the last the Cartoons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Windsor Castle is remarkable in many respects. Its tall, grey,
square towers, seated on a striking eminence, overlook for many miles
the subjacent country, and, eyed in the distance, lead the mind of the
solitary traveller to romantic musing; or, approached nearer, give the
heart a quicker and stronger pulsation. Windsor, besides its picturesque,
commanding situation, and its being the only palace in the
kingdom fit for the receptacle of ‘a line of kings,’ is the scene of
many classical associations. Who can pass through Datchet, and the
neighbouring greensward paths, and not think of Falstaff, of Ann
Page, and the oak of Herne the hunter? Or if he does not, still he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>is affected by them as if he did. The tall slim deer glance startled
by, in some neglected track of memory, and fairies trip it in the
unconscious haunts of the imagination! Pope’s lines on Windsor
Forest also suggest themselves to the mind in the same way, and
make the air about it delicate. Gray has consecrated the same spot
by his <cite>Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College</cite>; and the finest
passage in Burke’s writings is his comparison of the British Monarchy
to ‘the proud Keep of Windsor.’ The walls and massy towers of
Windsor Castle are indeed built of solid stone, weather-beaten, time-proof;
but the image answering to them in the mind’s eye is woven of
pure thought and the airy films of the imagination—Arachne’s web
not finer!</p>

<p class='c000'>The rooms are chill and comfortless at this time of the year,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and
gilded ceilings look down on smoky fire-places. The view from the
windows, too, which is so rich and glowing in the summer-time, is
desolate and deformed with the rains overflowing the marshy grounds.
As to physical comfort, one seems to have no more of it in these
tapestried halls and on marble floors, than the poor bird driven before
the pelting storm, or the ploughboy seeking shelter from the drizzling
sky, in his sheep-skin jacket and clouted shoes, beneath the dripping,
leafless spray. The palace does not (more than the hovel) always
defend us against the winter’s cold. The apartments are also filled
with too many rubbishly pictures of kings and queens—there are too
many of Verrio’s paintings, and a whole roomful of West’s; but
there are ten or twenty pictures which the eye, having once seen,
never loses sight of, and that make Windsor one of the retreats and
treasuries of art in this country. These, however, are chiefly pictures
which have a personal and individual interest attached to them, as we
have already hinted: there are very few historical compositions of
any value, and the subjects of the others are so desultory that the
young person who shows them, and goes through the names of the
painters and portraits very correctly, said she very nearly went out of
her mind in the three weeks she was ‘studying her part.’ It is a
matter of nomenclature: we hope we shall make as few blunders in
our report as she did.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first room the stranger is shown into, there are two large
landscapes by Zuccarelli. They are clever, well-painted pictures;
but they are worth nothing. The fault of this artist is, that there is
nothing absolutely good or bad in his pictures. They are mere
handicraft. The whole is done with a certain mechanical ease and
indifference; but it is evident no part of the picture gave him any
pleasure, and it is impossible it should give the spectator any. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>only ambition was to execute his task so as to save his credit; and
your first impulse is, to turn away from the picture, and save your
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the next room, there are four Vandykes—two of them excellent.
One is the Duchess of Richmond, a whole-length, in a white satin
drapery, with a pet lamb. The expression of her face is a little
sullen and capricious. The other, the Countess of Carlisle, has a
shrewd, clever, sensible countenance; and, in a certain archness of
look, and the contour of the lower part of the face, resembles the late
Mrs. Jordan.—Between these two portraits is a copy after Rembrandt,
by Gainsborough, a fine <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sombre</span></i>, mellow head, with the hat flapped
over the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the most delightful and interesting of the pictures in this
Collection, is the portrait by Vandyke, of Lady Venetia Digby. It
is an allegorical composition: but what truth, what purity, what
delicacy in the execution! You are introduced into the presence of
a beautiful woman of quality of a former age, and it would be next to
impossible to perform an unbecoming action with that portrait hanging
in the room. It has an air of nobility about it, a spirit of humanity
within it. There is a dove-like innocence and softness about the
eyes; in the clear, delicate complexion, health and sorrow contend
for the mastery; the mouth is sweetness itself, the nose highly
intelligent, and the forehead is one of ‘clear-spirited thought.’ But
misfortune has touched all this grace and beauty, and left its canker
there. This is shown no less by the air that pervades it, than by the
accompanying emblems. The children in particular are exquisitely
painted, and have an evident reference to those we lately noticed in
the <cite>Four Ages</cite>, by Titian. This portrait, both from the style and
subject, reminds one forcibly of Mrs. Hutchinson’s admirable
Memoirs of her own Life. Both are equally history, and the history
of the female heart (depicted, in the one case, by the pencil, in the
other, by the pen) in the finest age of female accomplishment and
pious devotion. Look at this portrait, breathing the beauty of virtue,
and compare it with the ‘Beauties’ of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>’s court, by Lely.
They look just like what they were—a set of kept-mistresses, painted,
tawdry, showing off their theatrical or meretricious airs and graces,
without one trace of real elegance or refinement, or one spark of
sentiment to touch the heart. Lady Grammont is the handsomest of
them; and, though the most voluptuous in her attire and attitude,
the most decent. The Duchess of Portsmouth, in her helmet and
plumes, looks quite like a heroine of romance or modern Amazon;
but for an air of easy assurance, inviting admiration, and alarmed at
nothing but being thought coy, commend us to my lady——above,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>in the sky-blue drapery, thrown carelessly across her shoulders! As
paintings, these celebrated portraits cannot rank very high. They
have an affected ease, but a real hardness of manner and execution;
and they have that contortion of attitude and setness of features which
we afterwards find carried to so disgusting and insipid an excess in
Kneller’s portraits. Sir Peter Lely was, however, a better painter
than Sir Godfrey Kneller—that is the highest praise that can be
accorded to him. He had more spirit, more originality, and was the
livelier coxcomb of the two! Both these painters possessed considerable
mechanical dexterity, but it is not of a refined kind. Neither of
them could be ranked among great painters, yet they were thought by
their contemporaries and themselves superior to every one. At the
distance of a hundred years we see the thing plainly enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same room with the portrait of Lady Digby, there is one
of Killigrew and Carew, by the same masterly hand. There is spirit
and character in the profile of Carew, while the head of Killigrew is
surprising from its composure and sedateness of aspect. He was one
of the grave wits of the day, who made nonsense a profound study,
and turned trifles into philosophy, and philosophy into a jest. The
pale, sallow complexion of this head is throughout in wonderful keeping.
The beard and face seem nearly of the same colour. We often
see this clear uniform colour of the skin in Titian’s portraits. But
then the dark eyes, beard, and eye-brows, give relief and distinctness.
The fair hair and complexions, that Vandyke usually painted, with
the almost total absence of shade from his pictures, made the task
more difficult; and, indeed, the prominence and effect he produces in
this respect, without any of the usual means, are almost miraculous.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several of his portraits, equestrian and others, of Charles
<span class='fss'>I.</span> in this Collection, some of them good, none of them first-rate.
Those of Henrietta (his Queen) are always delightful. The painter
has made her the most lady-like of Queens, and of women.</p>

<p class='c000'>The family picture of the Children of Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> is certainly
admirably painted and managed. The large mastiff-dog is inimitably
fine and true to nature, and seems as if he was made to be pulled
about by a parcel of royal infants from generation to generation. In
general, it may be objected to Vandyke’s <em>dressed</em> children, that they
look like little old men and women. His grown-up people had too
much stiffness and formality; and the same thing must quite overlay
the playfulness of infancy. Yet what a difference between these
young princes of the House of Stuart, and two of the princes of the
reigning family with their mother, by Ramsay, which are evident
likenesses to this hour!</p>

<p class='c000'>We have lost our reckoning as to the order of the pictures and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>rooms in which they are placed, and must proceed promiscuously
through the remainder of our Catalogue.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most noted pictures at Windsor is that of the <cite>Misers</cite>,
by Quintin Matsys. Its name is greater than its merits, like many
other pictures which have a lucky or intelligible subject, boldly
executed. The conception is good, the colouring bad; the drawing
firm, and the expression coarse and obvious. We are sorry to speak
at all disparagingly of Quintin Matsys; for the story goes that he was
originally bred a blacksmith, and turned painter to gain his master’s
daughter, who would give her hand to no one but on that condition.
Happy he who thus gained the object of his love, though posterity
may differ about his merits as an artist! Yet it is certain, that any
romantic incident of this kind, connected with a well-known work,
inclines us to regard it with a favourable instead of a critical eye, by
enhancing our pleasure in it; as the eccentric character, the wild
subjects, and the sounding name of Salvator Rosa have tended to lift
him into the highest rank of fame among painters.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the same room with the <cite>Misers</cite>, by the Blacksmith of Antwerp,
is a very different picture by Titian, consisting of two figures also,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> Himself and a Venetian Senator. It is one of the finest specimens
of this master. His own portrait is not much: it has spirit, but
is hard, with somewhat of a vulgar, knowing look. But the head of
the Senator is as fine as anything that ever proceeded from the hand
of man. The expression is a lambent flame, a soul of fire dimmed,
not quenched by age. The flesh <em>is</em> flesh. If Rubens’s pencil fed
upon roses, Titian’s was <em>carnivorous</em>. The tone is betwixt a gold and
silver hue. The texture and pencilling are marrowy. The dress is
a rich crimson, which seems to have been growing deeper ever since
it was painted. It is a front view. As far as attitude or action is
concerned, it is mere <em>still-life</em>; but the look is of that kind that goes
through you at a single glance. Let any one look well at this
portrait, and if he then sees nothing in it, or in the portraits of this
painter in general, let him give up <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">virtù</span></i> and criticism in despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>This room is rich in valuable gems, which might serve as a test of
a real taste for the art, depending for their value on intrinsic qualities,
and not on imposing subjects, or mechanical arrangement or quantity.
As where ‘the still, small voice of reason’ is wanting, we judge of
actions by noisy success and popularity; so where there is no true
moral sense in art, nothing goes down but pomp, and bustle, and pretension.
The eye of taste looks to see if a work has nature’s finest
image and superscription upon it, and for no other title and passport to
fame. There is a <cite>Young Man’s Head</cite>, (we believe in one corner of
this room) by Holbein, in which we can read high and heroic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>thoughts and resolutions, better than in any <cite>Continence of Scipio</cite> we
ever saw, or than in all the <cite>Battles of Alexander</cite> thrown into a lump.
There is a <cite>Portrait of Erasmus</cite>, by the same, and in the same or an
adjoining room, in which we see into the mind of a scholar and of an
amiable man, as through a window. There is a <cite>Head</cite> by Parmegiano,
lofty, triumphant, showing the spirit of another age and clime—one
by Raphael, studious and self-involved—another, said to be by
Leonardo da Vinci (but more like Holbein) grown crabbed with age
and thought—and a girl reading, by Correggio, intent on her subject,
and not forgetting herself. These are the materials of history; and
if it is not made of them, it is a nickname or a mockery. All that
does not lay open the fine net-work of the heart and brain of man,
that does not make us see deeper into the soul, is but the apparatus
and machinery of history-painting, and no more to it than the frame is
to the picture.</p>

<p class='c000'>We noticed a little <cite>Mater Dolorosa</cite> in one of the rooms, by Carlo
Dolci, which is a pale, pleasing, expressive head. There are two
large figures of his, a <cite>Magdalen</cite> and another, which are in the very
falsest style of colouring and expression; and <cite>Youth and Age</cite>, by
Denner, which are in as perfectly bad a taste and style of execution
as anything we ever saw of this artist, who was an adept in that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are afraid we have forgotten one or two meritorious pictures
which we meant to notice. There is one we just recollect, a <cite>Portrait
of a Youth</cite> in black, by Parmegiano. It is in a singular style, but
very bold, expressive, and natural. There is (in the same apartment
of the palace) a fine picture of the <cite>Battle of Norlingen</cite>, by Rubens.
The size and spirit of the horses in the fore-ground, and the obvious
animation of the riders, are finely contrasted with the airy perspective
and mechanical grouping of the armies at a distance; and so as to
prevent that confusion and want of positive relief, which usually
pervade Battle-pieces. In the same room (opposite) is Kneller’s
<cite>Chinese converted to Christianity</cite>—a portrait of which he was justly
proud. It is a fine oil-picture, clear, tawny, without trick or affectation,
and full of character. One of Kneller’s fine ladies or gentlemen,
with their wigs and <em>toupées</em>, would have been mortally offended to
have been so painted. The Chinese retains the same oily sly look,
after his conversion as before, and seems just as incapable of a
change of religion as a piece of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra cotta</span></i>. On each side of this
performance are two Guidos, the <cite>Perseus and Andromeda</cite>, and <cite>Venus
attired by the Graces</cite>. We give the preference to the former. The
Andromeda is a fine, noble figure, in a striking and even daring position,
with an impassioned and highly-wrought expression of features;
and the whole scene is in harmony with the subject. The <cite>Venus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>attired by the Graces</cite> (though full of beauties, particularly the colouring
of the flesh in the frail Goddess) is formal and disjointed in the composition;
and some of the actions are void of grace and even of
decorum. We allude particularly to the <cite>Maid-in-waiting</cite>, who is
combing her hair, and to the one tying on her sandals, with her arm
crossing Venus’s leg at right angles. The Cupid in the window is as
light and wanton as a butterfly flying out of it. He may be said to
flutter and hover in his own delights. There are two capital
engravings of these pictures by Strange.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>THE PICTURES AT HAMPTON COURT</h3>

<p class='c008'>This palace is a very magnificent one, and we think, has been
undeservedly neglected. It is Dutch-built, of handsome red brick,
and belongs to a class of houses, the taste for which appears to have
been naturalised in this country along with the happy introduction of
the Houses of Orange and Hanover. The approach to it through
Bushy-Park is delightful, inspiriting at this time of year; and the
gardens about it, with their close-clipped holly hedges and arbours
of evergreen, look an artificial summer all the year round. The
statues that are interspersed do not freeze in winter, and are cool
and classical in the warmer seasons. The <cite>Toy-Inn</cite> stands opportunely
at the entrance, to invite the feet of those who are tired of a straggling
walk from Brentford or Kew, or oppressed with thought and wonder
after seeing the Cartoons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides these last, however, there are several fine pictures here.
We shall pass over the Knellers, the Verrios, and the different
portraits of the Royal Family, and come at once to the <cite>Nine Muses</cite>,
by Tintoret. Or rather, his Nine Muses are summed up in one,
the back-figure in the right-hand corner as you look at the picture,
which is all grandeur, elegance, and grace.—We should think that in
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> of form and a noble freedom of outline, Michael Angelo
could hardly have surpassed this figure. The face too, which is half
turned round, is charmingly handsome. The back, the shoulders,
the legs, are the perfection of bold delicacy, expanded into full-blown
luxuriance, and then retiring as it were from their own proud beauty
and conscious charms into soft and airy loveliness—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Fine by degrees, and beautifully less.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Is it a Muse? Or is it not a figure formed for action more than
contemplation? Perhaps this hypercritical objection may be true;
and it might without any change of character or impropriety be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>supposed, from its buoyancy, its ease, and sinewy elasticity, to
represent the quivered Goddess shaping her bow for the chase. But,
at any rate, it is the figure of a Goddess, or of a woman in shape
equal to a Goddess. The colour is nearly gone, so that it has
almost the tone of a black and white chalk-drawing; and the effect
of form remains pure and unrivalled. There are several other very
pleasing and ably-drawn figures in the group, but they are eclipsed in
the superior splendour of this one. So far the composition is faulty,
for its balance is destroyed; and there are certain critics who could
probably maintain that the picture would be better, if this capital
excellence in it had been deliberately left out: the picture would,
indeed, have been more according to rule, and to the taste of those
who judge, feel, and see by rule only! Among the portraits which
are curious, is one of <cite>Baccio Bandinelli</cite>, with his emblems and
implements of sculpture about him, said to be by Correggio. We
cannot pretend to give an opinion on this point; but it is a studious,
powerful, and elaborately painted head. We find the name of Titian
attached to two or three portraits in the Collection. There is one
very fine one of a young man in black, with a black head of hair,
the face seen in a three-quarter view, and the dark piercing eye, full
of subtle meaning, looking round at you; which is probably by
Titian, but certainly not (as it is pretended) of himself. It has
not the aquiline cast of features by which his own portraits are
obviously distinguished. We have seen a print of this picture, in
which it is said to be done for Ignatius Loyola. The portrait
of a lady with green and white purfled sleeves (like the leaves and
flower of the water-lily, and as clear!) is admirable. It was in
the Pall-Mall exhibition of the Old Masters a short time ago;
and is by Sebastian del Piombo.—The care of the painting, the
natural ease of the attitude, and the steady, sensible, <em>conversable</em> look
of the countenance, place this in a class of pictures, which one feels
a wish to have always by one’s side, whenever there is a want of
thought, or a flaw in the temper, that requires filling up or setting
to rights by some agreeable and at the same time not over-exciting
object. There are several <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</span></i> Parmegianos; one or two good
Bassans; a <cite>Battle-Piece</cite> set down to Julio Romano; a coloured
drawing (in one corner of a room) of a <cite>Nymph</cite> and <cite>Satyr</cite> is very
fine; and some of Polemberg’s little disagreeable pictures of the
same subject, in which the Satyrs look like paltry bits of painted
wood, and the Nymphs like glazed China-ware. We have a
prejudice against Polemberg, which is a rare thing with us!</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Cartoons</cite> occupy a room by themselves—there are not many
such rooms in the world. All other pictures look like oil and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>varnish to these—we are stopped and attracted by the colouring,
the pencilling, the finishing, or the want of it, that is, by the instrumentalities
of the art—but here the painter seems to have flung his
<em>mind</em> upon the canvas; his thoughts, his great ideas alone prevail;
there is nothing between us and the subject; we look through
a frame, and see scripture-histories, and are made actual spectators
of miraculous events. Not to speak it profanely, they are a sort
of <em>revelation</em> of the subjects, of which they treat; there is an ease
and freedom of manner about them, which brings preternatural
characters and situations home to us, with the familiarity of common
every-day occurrences; and while the figures fill, raise, and satisfy
the mind, they seem to have cost the painter nothing. The Cartoons
are <em>unique</em> productions in the art. They are mere intellectual, or
rather <em>visible abstractions</em> of truth and nature. Every where else
we see the means; here we arrive at the end apparently without
any means. There is a Spirit at work in the divine creation before
us. We are unconscious of any details, of any steps taken, of any
progress made; we are aware only of comprehensive results, of
whole masses and figures. The sense of power supersedes the
appearance of effort. It is like a waking dream, vivid, but undistinguishable
in member, joint, or limb; or it is as if we had ourselves
seen the persons and things at some former period of our being, and
that the drawing certain dotted lines upon coarse paper, by some
unknown spell, brought back the entire and living images, and made
them pass before us, palpable to thought, to feeling, and to sight.
Perhaps not all is owing to genius: something of this effect may be
ascribed to the simplicity of the vehicle employed in embodying the
story, and something to the decayed and dilapidated state of the
pictures themselves. They are the more majestic for being in ruin:
we are struck chiefly with the truth of proportion, and the range
of conception: all the petty, meretricious part of the art is dead in
them; the carnal is made spiritual, the corruptible has put on incorruption,
and, amidst the wreck of colour, and the mouldering of
material beauty, nothing is left but a universe of thought, or the
broad, imminent shadows of ‘calm contemplation and majestic
pains!’</p>

<p class='c000'>The first in order is the <cite>Death of Ananias</cite>; and it is one of the
noblest of these noble designs. The effect is striking; and the
contrast between the steadfast, commanding attitude of the Apostles,
and the convulsed and prostrate figure of Ananias on the floor, is
finely imagined. It is much as if a group of persons on shore stood
to witness the wreck of life and hope on the rocks and quicksands
beneath them. The abruptness and severity of the transition are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>however, broken and relieved by the other human interests in the
picture. The Ananias is a masterly, a stupendous figure. The
attitude, the drawing, the expression, the ease, the force, are alike
wonderful. He falls so naturally, that it seems as if a person could
fall in no other way; and yet of all the ways in which a human
figure could fall, it is probably the most expressive of a person
overwhelmed by and in the grasp of Divine vengeance. This is in
some measure, we apprehend, the secret of Raphael’s success. Most
painters, in studying an attitude, puzzle themselves to find out what
will be picturesque, and what will be fine, and never discover it:
Raphael only thought how a person would stand or fall naturally in
such or such circumstances, and the <em>picturesque</em> and the <em>fine</em> followed
as matters of course. Hence the unaffected force and dignity of his
style, which are only another name for truth and nature under
impressive and momentous circumstances. The distraction of the
face, the inclination of the head on one side, are as fine as possible,
and the agony is just verging to that point, in which it is relieved by
death. The expression of ghastly wonder in the features of the man
on the floor next him is also remarkable; and the mingled beauty,
grief, and horror in the female head behind can never be enough
admired or extolled. The pain, the sudden and violent contraction
of the muscles, is as intense as if a sharp instrument had been driven
into the forehead, and yet the same sweetness triumphs there as ever,
the most perfect self-command and dignity of demeanour. We could
hazard a conjecture that this is what forms the great distinction
between the natural style of Raphael and the natural style of
Hogarth. Both are equally <em>intense</em>; but the one is intense littleness,
meanness, vulgarity; the other is intense grandeur, refinement,
and sublimity. In the one we see common, or sometimes uncommon
and painful, circumstances acting with all their force on narrow minds
and deformed bodies, and bringing out distorted and violent efforts at
expression; in the other we see noble forms and lofty characters
contending with adverse, or co-operating with powerful impressions
from without, and imparting their own unaltered grace, and habitual
composure to them. In Hogarth, generally, the face is excited and
torn in pieces by some paltry interest of its own; in Raphael, on the
contrary, it is expanded and ennobled by the contemplation of some
event or object highly interesting in itself: that is to say, the passion
in the one is intellectual and abstracted; the passion in the other is
petty, selfish, and confined. We have not thought it beneath the
dignity of the subject to make this comparison between two of the
most extraordinary and highly gifted persons that the world ever saw.
If Raphael had seen Hogarth’s pictures, <em>he</em> would not have despised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>them. Those only can do it (and they are welcome!) who, wanting
all that he had, can do nothing that he could not, or that they themselves
pretend to accomplish by affectation and bombast.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>Elymas the Sorcerer</cite> stands next in order, and is equal in merit.
There is a Roman sternness and severity in the general look of the
scene. The figure of the Apostle, who is inflicting the punishment
of blindness on the impostor, is grand, commanding, full of ease and
dignity: and the figure of Elymas is blind all over, and is muffled up
in its clothes from head to foot. A story is told of Mr. Garrick’s
objecting to the natural effect of the action, in the hearing of the late
Mr. West, who, in vindication of the painter, requested the celebrated
comedian to close his eyes and walk across the room, when he instantly
stretched out his hands, and began to grope his way with the exact
attitude and expression of this noble study. It may be worth remarking
here, that this great painter and fine observer of human nature
has represented the magician with a hard iron visage, and strong
uncouth figure, made up of bones and muscles, as one not troubled
with weak nerves, nor to be diverted from his purpose by idle
scruples, as one who repelled all sympathy with others, who was
not to be moved a jot by their censures or prejudices against him,
and who could break with ease through the cobweb snares which he
laid for the credulity of mankind, without being once entangled in
his own delusions. His outward form betrays the hard, unimaginative,
self-willed understanding of the Sorcerer.—There is a head (a profile)
coming in on one side of the picture, which we would point out to
our readers as one of the most finely relieved, and best preserved,
in this series. The face of Elymas, and some others in the picture,
have been a good deal hurt by time and ill-treatment. There is a
<em>snuffy</em> look under the nose, as if the water colour had been washed
away in some damp lumber-room, or unsheltered out-house. The
Cartoons have felt ‘the seasons’ difference,’ being exposed to wind
and rain, tossed about from place to place, and cut down by profane
hands to fit them to one of their abodes; so that it is altogether
wonderful, that ‘through their looped and tattered wretchedness,’
any traces are seen of their original splendour and beauty. That
they are greatly changed from what they were even a hundred years
ago, is evident from the heads in the Radcliffe library at Oxford,
which were cut out from one of them that was nearly destroyed by
some accident, and from the large French engravings of single heads,
done about the same time, which are as finished and correct as
possible. Even Sir James Thornhill’s copies bear testimony to the
same effect. Though without the spirit of the originals, they have
fewer blots and blotches in them, from having been better taken care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of. A skeleton is barely left of the Cartoons: but their mighty
relics, like the bones of the Mammoth, tell us what the entire and
living fabric must have been!</p>

<p class='c000'>In the <cite>Gate Beautiful</cite> there is a profusion of what is fine, and of
imposing contrasts. The twisted pillars have been found fault with;
but there they stand, and will for ever stand to answer all cavillers
with their wreathed beauty. The St. John in this Cartoon is an
instance of what we have above hinted as to the ravages of time on
these pictures. In the old French engraving (half the size of life)
the features are exceedingly well marked and beautiful, whereas
they are here in a great measure defaced; and the hair, which is
at present a mere clotted mass, is woven into graceful and waving
curls,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like to those hanging locks</div>
      <div class='line'>Of young Apollo.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Great inroads have been made on the delicate outline of the other
parts, and the surface has been generally injured. The Beggars are
as fine as ever: they do not lose by the squalid condition of their
garb or features, but remain patriarchs of poverty, and mighty in
disease and infirmity, as if they crawled and grovelled on the
pavement of Heaven. They are lifted above this world! The
child carrying the doves at his back is an exquisite example of
grace, and innocence, and buoyant motion; and the face and figure
of the young woman seen directly over him give a glad welcome
to the eye in their fresh, unalloyed, and radiant sweetness and joy.
This head seems to have been spared from the unhallowed touch of
injury, like a little isle or circlet of beauty. It was guarded, we
may suppose, by its own heavenly, feminine look of smiling loveliness.
There is another very fine female head on the opposite side of the
picture, of a graver cast, looking down, and nearly in profile. The
only part of this Cartoon that we object to, or should be for <em>turning
out</em>, is the lubberly naked figure of a boy close to one of the
pillars, who seems to have no sort of business there, and is an obvious
eye-sore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Miraculous Draught of Fishes</cite> is admirable for the clearness
and prominence of the figures, for the vigorous marking of the
muscles, for the fine expression of devout emotion in the St. Peter,
and for the calm dignity in the attitude, and divine benignity in the
countenance of the Christ. Perhaps this head expresses, more than
any other that ever was attempted, the blended meekness, benevolence,
and sublimity in the character of our Saviour. The whole figure is
so still, so easy, it almost floats in air, and seems to sustain the boat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>by the secret sense of power. We shall not attempt to make a formal
reply to the old objection to the diminutive size of the boat, but we
confess it appears to us to enhance the value of the miracle. Its
load swells proportionably in comparison, and the waves conspire to
bear it up. The Storks on the shore are not the least animated or
elevated part of the picture; they exult in the display of divine power,
and share in the prodigality of the occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Sacrifice at Lystra</cite> has the marks of Raphael’s hand on every
part of it. You see and almost hear what is passing. What a
pleasing relief to the confused, busy scene, are the two children
piping at the altar! How finely, how unexpectedly, but naturally,
that innocent rustic head of a girl comes in over the grave countenances
and weighty, thoughtful heads of the group of attendant
priests! The animals brought to be sacrificed are equally fine in
the expression of terror, and the action of resistance to the rude force
by which they are dragged along.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great deal has been said and written on the <cite>St. Paul preaching
at Athens</cite>. The features of excellence in this composition are indeed
so bold and striking as hardly to be mistaken. The abrupt figure
of St. Paul, his hands raised in that fervent appeal to Him who
‘dwelleth not in temples made with hands,’ such as are seen in
gorgeous splendour all around, the circle of his auditors, the noble
and pointed diversity of heads, the one wrapped in thought and in its
cowl, another resting on a crutch and earnestly scanning the face of
the Apostle rather than his doctrine, the careless attention of the
Epicurean philosopher, the fine young heads of the disciples of the
Porch or the Academy, the clenched fist and eager curiosity of
the man in front as if he was drinking sounds, give this picture a
superiority over all the others for popular and intelligible effect. We
do not think that it is therefore the best; but it is the easiest to
describe and to remember.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite>Giving of the Keys</cite> is the last of them: it is at present at
Somerset-House. There is no set purpose here, no studied contrast:
it is an aggregation of grandeur and high feeling. The disciples
gather round Christ, like a flock of sheep listening to some divine
shepherd. The figure of their master is sublime: his countenance
and attitude ‘in act to speak.’ The landscape is also extremely fine
and of a soothing character.—Every thing falls into its place in these
pictures. The figures seem to stop just where their business and
feelings bring them: not a fold in the draperies can be disposed of
for the better or otherwise than it is.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be in vain to enumerate the particular figures, or to
explain the story of works so well known: what we have aimed at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>has been to shew the spirit that breathes through them, and we shall
count ourselves fortunate, if we have not sullied them with our praise.
We do not care about some works: but these were sacred to our
imaginations, and we should be sorry indeed to have profaned them
by description or criticism. We have hurried through our unavoidable
task with fear, and look back to it with doubt.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Having repeated these lines to ourselves, we sit quietly down in
our chairs to con over our task, abstract the idea of exclusive property,
and think only of those images of beauty and of grandeur, which we
can carry away with us in our minds, and have every where before
us. Let us take some of these, and describe them how we can.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one—we see it now—the <cite>Man with a Hawk</cite>, by
Rembrandt. ‘In our mind’s eye, Horatio!’ What is the
difference between this idea which we have brought away with us,
and the picture on the wall? Has it lost any of its tone, its ease,
its depth? The head turns round in the same graceful moving
attitude, the eye carelessly meets ours, the tufted beard grows to the
chin, the hawk flutters and balances himself on his favourite perch,
his master’s hand; and a shadow seems passing over the picture, just
leaving a light in one corner of it behind, to give a livelier effect to
the whole. There is no mark of the pencil, no jagged points or solid
masses; it is all air, and twilight might be supposed to have drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>his veil across it. It is as much an idea on the canvas, as it is in
the mind. There are no means employed, as far as you can discover—you
see nothing but a simple, grand, and natural effect. It is
impalpable as a thought, intangible as a sound—nay, the shadows
have a breathing harmony, and fling round an undulating echo of
themselves,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘At every fall smoothing the raven down</div>
      <div class='line'>Of darkness till it smiles!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the opposite corner of the room is a <cite>Portrait of a Female</cite> (by
the same), in which every thing is as clear, and pointed, and brought
out into the open day, as in the former it is withdrawn from close
and minute inspection. The face glitters with smiles as the ear-rings
sparkle with light. The whole is stiff, starched, and formal, has a
pearly or metallic look, and you throughout mark the most elaborate
and careful finishing. The two pictures make an antithesis, where
they are placed; but this was not probably at all intended: it
proceeds simply from the difference in the nature of the subject, and
the truth and appropriate power of the treatment of it.—In the
middle between these two pictures is a small history, by Rembrandt,
of the <cite>Salutation of Elizabeth</cite>, in which the figures come out straggling,
disjointed, quaint, ugly as in a dream, but partake of the mysterious
significance of preternatural communication, and are seen through the
visible gloom, or through the dimmer night of antiquity. Light and
shade, not form or feeling, were the elements of which Rembrandt
composed the finest poetry, and his imagination brooded only over the
medium through which we discern objects, leaving the objects themselves
uninspired, unhallowed, and untouched!</p>

<p class='c000'>We must go through our account of these pictures as they start up
in our memory, not according to the order of their arrangement, for
want of a proper set of memorandums. Our friend, Mr. Gummow,
of Cleveland-house, had a nice little neatly-bound duodecimo Catalogue,
of great use as a <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vade Mecum</span></cite> to occasional visitants or absent critics—but
here we have no such advantage; and to take notes before
company is a thing that we abhor. It has a look of pilfering something
from the pictures. While we merely enjoy the sight of the
objects of art before us, or sympathise with the approving gaze of
the greater beauty around us, it is well; there is a feeling of luxury
and refinement in the employment; but take out a pocket-book, and
begin to scribble notes in it, the date of the picture, the name, the
room, some paltry defect, some pitiful discovery (not worth remembering),
the non-essentials, the mechanic <em>common-places</em> of the art, and
the sentiment is gone—you shew that you have a further object in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>view, a job to execute, a feeling foreign to the place, and different
from every one else—you become a butt and a mark for ridicule to
the rest of the company—and you retire with your pockets full of
wisdom from a saloon of art, with as little right as you have to carry
off the dessert, (or what you have not been able to consume,) from
an inn, or a banquet. Such, at least, is our feeling; and we had
rather make a mistake now and then, as to a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">numero</span></i>, or the name of
a room in which a picture is placed, than spoil our whole pleasure in
looking at a fine Collection, and consequently the pleasure of the
reader in learning what we thought of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the pictures that haunt our eye in this way is the <cite>Adoration
of the Angels</cite>, by N. Poussin. It is one of his finest works—elegant,
graceful, full of feeling, happy, enlivening. It is treated rather as a
classical than as a sacred subject. The Angels are more like Cupids
than Angels. They are, however, beautifully grouped, with various
and expressive attitudes, and remind one, by their half antic, half
serious homage, of the line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They are laden with baskets of flowers—the tone of the picture is
rosy, florid; it seems to have been painted at</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>and the angels over-head sport and gambol in the air with butterfly-wings,
like butterflies. It is one of those rare productions that satisfy
the mind, and from which we turn away, not from weariness, but from
a fulness of delight.—The <cite>Israelites returning Thanks in the Wilderness</cite>
is a fine picture, but inferior to this. Near it is a group of Angels,
said to be by Correggio. The expressions are grotesque and fine,
but the colouring does not seem to us to be his. The texture of the
flesh, as well as the hue, too much resembles the skin of ripe fruit.
We meet with several fine landscapes of the two Poussins, (particularly
one of a rocky eminence by Gaspar,) in the room before you come
to the Rembrandts, in which the mixture of grey rock and green
trees and shrubs is beautifully managed, with striking truth and
clearness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among detached and smaller pictures, we would wish to point out
to the attention of our readers, an exquisite head of a <cite>Child</cite>, by
Andrea del Sarto, and a fine Salvator in the inner room of all: in the
room leading to it, a pleasing, glassy Cuyp, an airy, earthy-looking
Teniers, and <cite>a Mother and a Sleeping Child</cite>, by Guido: in the Saloon,
a <cite>St. Catherine</cite>, one of Parmegiano’s most graceful pictures; a <cite>St.
Agnes</cite>, by Domenichino, full of sweetness, thought, and feeling; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>two pictures by Raphael, that have a look as if painted on paper: a
<cite>Repose in Egypt</cite>, and <cite>St. Luke painting the Virgin</cite>, both admirable
for drawing and expression, and a rich, purple, <em>crayon</em> tone of
colouring. Wherever Raphael is, there is grace and dignity, and
an informing soul. In the last-mentioned room, near the entrance, is
also a <cite>Conversion of Saint Paul</cite>, by Rubens, of infinite spirit,
brilliancy, and delicacy of execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is in the large room to the right, that the splendour and
power of Rubens reign triumphant and unrivalled, and yet he has
here to contend with highest works and names. The four large
pictures of ecclesiastical subjects, the <cite>Meeting of Abram and Melchisedec</cite>,
the <cite>Gathering of Manna</cite>, the <cite>Evangelists</cite>, and the <cite>Fathers of the Church</cite>,
have no match in this country for scenic pomp, and dazzling airy
effect. The figures are colossal; and it might be said, without much
extravagance, that the drawing and colouring are so too.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> He seems
to have painted with a huge sweeping gigantic pencil, and with broad
masses of unalloyed colour. The spectator is (as it were) thrown
back by the pictures, and surveys them, as if placed at a stupendous
height, as well as distance from him. This, indeed, is their history:
they were painted to be placed in some Jesuit’s church abroad, at an
elevation of forty or fifty feet, and Rubens would have started to see
them in a drawing-room or on the ground. Had he foreseen such a
result, he would perhaps have added something to the correctness of
the features, and taken something from the gorgeous crudeness of the
colour. But there is grandeur of composition, involution of form,
motion, character in its vast, rude outline, the imposing contrast of
sky and flesh, fine grotesque heads of old age, florid youth, and fawn-like
beauty! You see nothing but patriarchs, primeval men and
women, walking among temples, or treading the sky—or the earth,
with an ‘air and gesture proudly eminent,’ as if they trod the sky—when
man first rose from nothing to his native sublimity. We cannot
describe these pictures in their details; they are one staggering blow
after another of the mighty hand that traced them. All is cast in
the same mould, all is filled with the same spirit, all is clad in the
same gaudy robe of light. Rubens was at home here; his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i> was
the processional, the showy, and the imposing; he grew almost
drunk and wanton with the sense of his power over such subjects;
and he, in fact, left these pictures unfinished in some particulars, that,
for the place and object for which they were intended, they might be
perfect. They were done (it is said) for tapestries from small
designs, and carried nearly to their present state of finishing by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>scholars. There is a smaller picture in the same room, <cite>Ixion
embracing the false Juno</cite>, which points out and defines their style of
art and adaptation for remote effect. There is a delicacy in this
last picture (which is, however of the size of life) that makes it
look like a miniature in comparison. The flesh of the women is like
lilies, or like milk strewed upon ivory. It is soft and pearly; but,
in the larger pictures, it is heightened beyond nature, the veil of air
between the spectator and the figures, when placed in the proper
position, being supposed to give the last finishing. Near the <cite>Ixion</cite> is
an historical female figure, by Guido, which will not bear any comparison
for transparency and delicacy of tint with the two Junos.—Rubens
was undoubtedly the greatest <em>scene-painter</em> in the world, if we
except Paul Veronese, and the Fleming was to him flat and insipid.
‘It is place which lessens and sets off.’ We once saw two pictures
of Rubens’ hung by the side of the <cite>Marriage of Cana</cite> in the Louvre;
and they looked nothing. The Paul Veronese nearly occupied the
side of a large room (the modern French exhibition-room) and it was
like looking through the side of a wall, or at a splendid banquet and
gallery, full of people, and full of interest. The texture of the two
Rubenses was <em>woolly</em>, or flowery, or <em>satiny</em>: it was all alike; but in
the Venetian’s great work the pillars were of stone, the floor was
marble, the tables were wood, the dresses were various stuffs, the sky
was air, the flesh was flesh; the groups were living men and women.
Turks, emperours, ladies, painters, musicians—all was real, dazzling,
profuse, astonishing. It seemed as if the very dogs under the table
might get up and bark, or that at the sound of a trumpet the whole
assembly might rise and disperse in different directions, in an instant.
This picture, however, was considered as the triumph of Paul
Veronese, and the two by the Flemish artist that hung beside it
were very inferior to some of his, and assuredly to those now
exhibited in the Gallery at Lord Grosvenor’s. Neither do we wish
by this allusion to disparage Rubens; for we think him on the whole
a greater genius, and a greater painter, than the rival we have here
opposed to him, as we may attempt to shew when we come to speak
of the Collection at Blenheim.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some divine Claudes in the same room; and they too
are like looking through a window at a select and conscious landscape.
There are five or six, all capital for the composition, and highly
preserved. There is a strange and somewhat <em>anomalous</em> one of <cite>Christ
in the Mount</cite>, as if the artist had tried to contradict himself, and yet
it is Claude all over. Nobody but he could paint one single atom of
it. The <cite>Mount</cite> is stuck up in the very centre of the picture, against
all rule, like a huge dirt-pye: but then what an air breathes round it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>what a sea encircles it, what verdure clothes it, what flocks and herds
feed round it, immortal and unchanged! Close by it is the <cite>Arch of
Constantine</cite>; but this is to us a bitter disappointment. A print of it
hung in a little room in the country, where we used to contemplate it
by the hour together, and day after day, and ‘<em>sigh our souls</em>’ into
the picture. It was the most graceful, the most perfect of all Claude’s
compositions. The Temple seemed to come forward into the middle
of the picture, as in a dance, to show its unrivalled beauty, the
Vashti of the scene! Young trees bent their branches over it with
playful tenderness; and, on the opposite side of a stream, at which
cattle stooped to drink, there grew a stately grove, erect, with answering
looks of beauty: the distance between retired into air and
gleaming shores. Never was there scene so fair, ‘so absolute, that
in itself summ’d all delight.’ How did we wish to compare it with
the picture! The trees, we thought, must be of vernal green—the
sky recalled the mild dawn, or softened evening. No, the branches
of the trees are red, the sky burned up, the whole hard and uncomfortable.
This is not the picture, the print of which we used to gaze at
enamoured—there is another somewhere that we still shall see! There
are finer specimens of the <cite>Morning</cite> and <cite>Evening of the Roman Empire</cite>,
at Lord Radnor’s, in Wiltshire. Those here have a more polished,
<em>cleaned</em> look, but we cannot prefer them on that account. In one
corner of the room is a <cite>St. Bruno</cite>, by Andrea Sacchi—a fine study,
with pale face and garments, a saint dying (as it should seem)—but
as he dies, conscious of an undying spirit. The old Catholic painters
put the soul of religion into their pictures—for they felt it within
themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two Titians—<em>the Woman taken in Adultery</em>, and a large
mountainous landscape with the story of <cite>Jupiter and Antiope</cite>. The
last is rich and striking, but not equal to his best; and the former,
we think, one of his most exceptionable pictures, both in character,
and (we add) colouring. In the last particular, it is tricky, and
discovers, instead of concealing its art. The flesh is not transparent,
but a <em>transparency</em>! Let us not forget a fine Synders, a <cite>Boar-hunt</cite>,
which is highly spirited and natural, as far as the animals are concerned;
but is <em>patchy</em>, and wants the tone and general effect that
Rubens would have thrown over it. In the middle of the right-hand
side of the room, is the <cite>Meeting of Jacob and Laban</cite>, by Murillo. It
is a lively, out-of-door scene, full of bustle and expression; but it
rather brings us to the tents and faces of two bands of gypsies meeting
on a common heath, than carries us back to the remote times, places,
and events, treated of. Murillo was the painter of nature, not of
the imagination. There is a <cite>Sleeping Child</cite> by him, over the door of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>the saloon (an admirable cabinet-picture), and another of a boy, a
little spirited rustic, brown, glowing, ‘of the earth, earthy,’ the flesh
thoroughly baked, as if he had come out of an oven; and who regards
you with a look as if he was afraid you might bind him apprentice to
some trade or handicraft, or send him to a Sunday-school; and so
put an end to his short, happy, careless life—to his lessons from that
great teacher, the Sun—to his physic, the air—to his bed, the earth—and
to the soul of his very being, Liberty!</p>

<p class='c000'>The first room you enter is filled with some very good and some
very bad English pictures. There is Hogarth’s <cite>Distressed Poet</cite>—the
<cite>Death of Wolfe</cite>, by West, which is not so good as the print would
lead us to expect—an excellent whole-length portrait of a youth, by
Gainsborough—<cite>A Man with a Hawk</cite>, by Northcote, and <cite>Mrs.
Siddons as the Tragic Muse</cite>, by Sir Joshua. This portrait Lord
Grosvenor bought the other day for £1760. It has risen in price
every time it has been sold. Sir Joshua sold it for two or three
hundred pounds to a Mr. Calonne. It was then purchased by Mr.
Desenfans who parted with it to Mr. William Smith for a larger sum
(we believe £500); and at the sale of that gentleman’s pictures, it
was bought by Mr. Watson Taylor, the last proprietor, for a thousand
guineas. While it was in the possession of Mr. Desenfans, a copy of
it was taken by a pupil of Sir Joshua’s, of the name of Score, which
is now in the Dulwich Gallery, and which we always took for an
original. The size of the original is larger than the copy. There
was a dead child painted at the bottom of it, which Sir Joshua
Reynolds afterwards disliked, and he had the canvas doubled upon
the frame to hide it. It has been let out again, but we did not observe
whether the child was there. We think it had better not be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not wish to draw invidious comparisons; yet we may say,
in reference to the pictures in Lord Grosvenor’s Collection, and those
at Cleveland-house, that the former are distinguished most by elegance,
brilliancy, and high preservation; while those belonging to the
Marquis of Stafford look more like old pictures, and have a corresponding
tone of richness and magnificence. We have endeavoured
to do justice to both, but we confess we have fallen very short even
of our own hopes and expectations.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>PICTURES AT WILTON, STOURHEAD, &amp;c.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Salisbury Plain, barren as it is, is rich in collections and monuments
of art. There are, within the distance of a few miles, Wilton,
Longford-Castle, Fonthill-Abbey, Stourhead, and last though not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>least worthy to be mentioned, Stonehenge, that ‘huge, dumb heap,’
that stands on the blasted heath, and looks like a group of giants,
bewildered, not knowing what to do, encumbering the earth, and
turned to stone, while in the act of warring on Heaven. An attempt
has lately been made to give to it an antediluvian origin. Its mystic
round is in all probability fated to remain inscrutable, a mighty maze
without a plan: but still the imagination, when once curiosity and
wonder have taken possession of it, heaves with its restless load,
launches conjecture farther and farther back beyond the landmarks
of time, and strives to bear down all impediments in its course, as the
ocean strives to overleap some vast promontory!</p>

<p class='c000'>Fonthill-Abbey, which was formerly hermetically sealed against all
intrusion,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> is at present open to the whole world; and Wilton-House,
and Longford-Castle, which were formerly open to every one, are at
present shut, except to <em>petitioners</em>, and a favoured few. Why is this
greater degree of strictness in the latter instances resorted to? In
proportion as the taste for works of art becomes more general, do
these Noble Persons wish to set bounds to and disappoint public
curiosity? Do they think that the admiration bestowed on fine
pictures or rare sculpture lessens their value, or divides the property,
as well as the pleasure with the possessor? Or do they think that
setting aside the formality of these new regulations, three persons in
the course of a whole year would intrude out of an impertinent
curiosity to see <em>their</em> houses and furniture, without having a just value
for them as objects of art? Or is the expence of keeping servants to
shew the apartments made the plea of this churlish, narrow system?
The public are ready enough to pay servants for their attendance, and
those persons are quite as forward to do this who make a pilgrimage
to such places on foot as those who approach them in a post-chaise or
on horseback with a livery servant, which, it seems, is the prescribed
and fashionable etiquette! Whatever is the cause, we are sorry for
it; more particularly as it compels us to speak of these two admired
Collections from memory only. It is several years since we saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>them; but there are some impressions of this sort that are proof
against time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord Radnor has the two famous Claudes, the <cite>Morning</cite> and
<cite>Evening of the Roman Empire</cite>. Though as landscapes they are
neither so brilliant, nor finished, nor varied, as some of this Artist’s,
there is a weight and concentration of historic feeling about them
which many of his allegorical productions want. In the first, half-finished
buildings and massy columns rise amidst the dawning effulgence
that is streaked with rims of inextinguishable light; and a noble tree
in the foreground, ample, luxuriant, hangs and broods over the
growing design. There is a dim mistiness spread over the scene, as
in the beginning of things. The <cite>Evening</cite>, the companion to it, is
even finer. It has all the gorgeous pomp that attends the meeting of
Night and Day, and a flood of glory still prevails over the coming
shadows. In the cool of the evening, some cattle are feeding on the
brink of a glassy stream, that reflects a mouldering ruin on one side
of the picture; and so precise is the touch, so true, so firm is the
pencilling, so classical the outline, that they give one the idea of
sculptured cattle, biting the short, green turf, and seem an enchanted
herd! They appear stamped on the canvas to remain there for ever,
or as if nothing could root them from the spot. Truth with beauty
suggests the feeling of immortality. No Dutch picture ever suggested
this feeling. The objects are real, it is true; but not being beautiful
or impressive, the mind feels no wish to mould them into a permanent
reality, to bind them fondly on the heart, or lock them in the imagination
as in a sacred recess, safe from the envious canker of time. No
one ever felt a longing, a sickness of the heart, to see a Dutch landscape
twice; but those of Claude, after an absence of years, have
this effect, and produce a kind of calenture. The reason of the
difference is, that in mere literal copies from nature, where the objects
are not interesting in themselves, the only attraction is to see the
felicity of the execution; and having once witnessed this, we are
satisfied. But there is nothing to stir the fancy, to keep alive the
yearnings of passion. We remember one other picture (and but one)
in Lord Radnor’s Collection, that was of this <em>ideal</em> character. It
was a <cite>Magdalen</cite> by Guido, with streaming hair, and streaming eyes
looking upwards-full of sentiment and beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is but one fine picture at Wilton-house, the <cite>Family Vandyke</cite>;
with a noble Gallery of antique marbles, which we may pronounce to
be invaluable to the lover of art or to the student of history or human
nature. Roman Emperors or Proconsuls, the poets, orators, and
almost all the great men of antiquity, are here ‘ranged in a row,’ and
palpably embodied either in genuine or traditional busts. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>these indicate an almost preternatural capacity and inspired awfulness
of look, particularly some of the earlier sages and fabulists of Greece,
which we apprehend to be <em>ideal</em> representations; while other more
modern and better authenticated ones of celebrated Romans are
distinguished by the strength and simplicity of common English heads
of the best class.—The large picture of the <cite>Pembroke Family</cite>, by
Vandyke, is unrivalled in its kind. It is a history of the time. It
throws us nearly two centuries back to men and manners that no
longer exist. The members of a Noble House (‘tis a hundred and
sixty years since) are brought together <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ persona</span></i>, and appear
in all the varieties of age, character, and costume. There are the old
Lord and Lady Pembroke, who ‘keep their state’ raised somewhat
above the other groups;—the one a lively old gentleman, who seems
as if he could once have whispered a flattering tale in a fair lady’s
ear; his help-mate looking a little fat and sulky by his side, probably
calculating the expence of the picture, and not well understanding the
event of it—there are the daughters, pretty, well-dressed, elegant
girls, but somewhat insipid, sentimental, and vacant—then there are
the two eldest sons, that might be said to have walked out of Mr.
Burke’s description of the age of chivalry; the one a perfect courtier,
a carpet-knight, smooth-faced, handsome, almost effeminate, that
seems to have moved all his life to ‘the mood of lutes and soft
recorders,’ decked in silks and embroidery like the tender flower
issuing from its glossy folds; the other the gallant soldier, shrewd,
bold, hardy, with spurred heel and tawny buskins, ready to ‘mount
on barbed steeds, and witch the world with noble horsemanship’—down
to the untutored, carroty-headed boy, the <cite>Goose-Gibbie</cite> of the
piece, who appears to have been just dragged from the farm-yard to
sit for his picture, and stares about him in as great a heat and fright
as if he had dropped from the clouds:—all in this admirable, living
composition is in its place, in keeping, and bears the stamp of the age
and of the master’s hand. Even the oak-pannels have an elaborate,
antiquated look, and the furniture has an aspect of cumbrous, conscious
dignity. It should not be omitted that it was here (in the house or
the adjoining magnificent grounds) that Sir Philip Sidney wrote his
<span class='sc'>Arcadia</span>; and the story of Musidorus and Philoclea, of Mopsa and
Dorcas, is quaintly traced on oval pannels in the principal drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is on this account that we are compelled to find fault with the
Collection at Fonthill Abbey, because it exhibits no picture of
remarkable eminence that can be ranked as an heir-loom of the
imagination—which cannot be spoken of but our thoughts take wing
and stretch themselves towards it—the very name of which is music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to the instructed ear. We would not give a rush to see any Collection
that does not contain some single picture at least, that haunts us with
an uneasy sense of joy for twenty miles of road, that may cheer us at
intervals for twenty years of life to come. Without some such
thoughts as these riveted in the brain, the lover and disciple of art
would truly be ‘of all men the most miserable:’ but with them
hovering round him, and ever and anon shining with their glad lustre
into his sleepless soul, he has nothing to fear from fate, or fortune.
We look, and lo! here is one at our side, facing us, though far-distant.
It is the Young Man’s Head, in the Louvre, by Titian,
that is not unlike Jeronymo della Porretta in Sir Charles Grandison.
What a look is there of calm, unalterable self-possession—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Above all pain, all passion, and all pride;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>that draws the evil out of human life, that while we look at it
transfers the same sentiment to our own breasts, and makes us feel as
if nothing mean or little could ever disturb us again! This is high
art; the rest is mechanical. But there is nothing like this at Fonthill
(oh! no), but every thing which is the very reverse. As this, however,
is an extreme opinion of ours, and may be a prejudice, we shall
endeavour to support it by facts. There is not then a single Titian
in all this boasted and expensive Collection—there is not a Raphael—there
is not a Rubens (except one small sketch)—there is not a
Guido, nor a Vandyke—there is not a Rembrandt, there is not a
Nicolo Poussin, nor a fine Claude. The two Altieri Claudes, which
might have redeemed Fonthill, Mr. Beckford sold. What shall we
say to a Collection, which uniformly and deliberately rejects every
great work, and every great name in art, to make room for idle
rarities and curiosities of mechanical skill? It was hardly necessary
to build a cathedral to set up a toy-shop! Who would paint a
miniature-picture to hang it at the top of the Monument? This huge
pile (capable of better things) is cut up into a parcel of little rooms,
and those little rooms are stuck full of little pictures, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bijouterie</span></i>.
Mr. Beckford may talk of his <cite>Diamond Berchem</cite>, and so on: this is
but the language of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitre</span></i> in art; but the author of <span class='sc'>Vathek</span>
(with his leave) is not a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitre</span></i>. His genius, as a writer, ‘hath
a devil:’ his taste in pictures is the quintessence and rectified spirit
of <em>still-life</em>. He seems not to be susceptible of the poetry of painting,
or else to set his face against it. It is obviously a first principle with
him to exclude whatever has feeling or imagination—to polish the
surface, and suppress the soul of art—to proscribe, by a sweeping
clause or at one fell swoop, every thing approaching to grace, or beauty,
or grandeur—to crush the sense of pleasure or of power in embryo—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to reduce all nature and art, as far as possible, to the texture
and level of a China dish—smooth, glittering, cold, and unfeeling!
We do not object so much to the predilection for Teniers, Wouvermans,
or Ostade—we like to see natural objects naturally painted—but
we unequivocally hate the affectedly mean, the elaborately little,
the ostentatiously perverse and distorted, Polemberg’s walls of amber,
Mieris’s groups of steel, Vanderwerf’s ivory flesh;—yet these are the
chief delights of the late proprietor of Fonthill-abbey! Is it that his
mind is ‘a volcano burnt out,’ and that he likes his senses to repose
and be gratified with Persian carpets and enamelled pictures? Or
are there not traces of the same infirmity of feeling even in the high-souled
Vathek, who compliments the complexion of the two pages of
Fakreddin as being equal to ‘the porcelain of Franguestan?’ Alas!
Who would have thought that the Caliph Vathek would have
dwindled down into an Emperor of China and King of Japan? But
so it is.—</p>

<p class='c000'>Stourhead, the seat of Sir Richard Colt Hoare, did not answer
our expectations. But Stourton, the village where it stands, made up
for our disappointment. After passing the park-gate, which is a
beautiful and venerable relic, you descend into Stourton by a sharp-winding
declivity, almost like going underground, between high
hedges of laurel trees, and with an expanse of woods and water spread
beneath. It is a sort of rural Herculaneum, a subterranean retreat.
The inn is like a modernized guard-house; the village-church stands
on a lawn without any inclosure; a row of cottages facing it, with
their white-washed walls and flaunting honey-suckles, are neatness
itself. Every thing has an air of elegance, and yet tells a tale of
other times. It is a place that might be held sacred to stillness and
solitary musing!—The adjoining mansion of Stourhead commands an
extensive view of Salisbury Plain, whose undulating swells shew the
earth in its primeval simplicity, bare, with naked breasts, and varied
in its appearance only by the shadows of the clouds that pass across
it. The view without is pleasing and singular: there is little within-doors
to beguile attention. There is one master-piece of colouring
by Paul Veronese, a naked child with a dog. The tone of the flesh
is perfection itself. On praising this picture (which we always do
when we like a thing) we were told it had been criticized by a great
judge, Mr. Beckford of Fonthill, who had found fault with the
execution as too coarse and muscular. We do not wonder—it is not
like his own turnery-ware! We should also mention an exquisite
Holbein, the <cite>Head of a Child</cite>, and a very pleasing little landscape by
Wilson. Besides these, there are some capital pen-and-ink drawings
(views in Venice), by Canaletti, and three large copies after Guido
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of <em>the Venus attired by the Graces</em>, <em>the Andromeda</em>, and <cite>Herodias’s
Daughter</cite>. They breathe the soul of softness and grace, and remind
one of those fair, sylph-like forms that sometimes descend upon the
earth with fatal, fascinating looks, and that ‘tempt but to betray.’
After the cabinet-pictures at Fonthill, even a good copy of a Guido is
a luxury and a relief to the mind: it is something to inhale the divine
airs that play around his figures, and we are satisfied if we can but
‘trace his footsteps, and his skirts far-off behold.’ The rest of this
Collection is, for the most part, <em>trash</em>: either Italian pictures painted in
the beginning of the last century, or English ones in the beginning of
this. It gave us pain to see some of the latter; and we willingly
draw a veil over the humiliation of the art, in the age and country
that we live in. We ought, however, to mention a portrait of a
youth (the present proprietor of Stourhead) by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
which is elegant, brilliant, ‘though in ruins;’ and a spirited portrait
by Northcote, of a lady talking on her fingers, may, perhaps, challenge
an exception for itself to the above general censure.</p>

<p class='c000'>We wish our readers to go to Petworth, the seat of Lord
Egremont, where they will find the coolest grottos and the finest
Vandykes in the world. There are eight or ten of the latter that are
not to be surpassed by the art of man, and that we have no power
either to admire or praise as they deserve. For simplicity, for
richness, for truth of nature, for airiness of execution, nothing ever
was or can be finer. We will only mention those of the Earl and
Countess of Northumberland, Lord Newport, and Lord Goring,
Lord Strafford, and Lady Carr, and the Duchess of Devonshire.
He who possesses these portraits is rich indeed, if he has an eye to
see, and a heart to feel them. The one of <cite>Lord Northumberland in
the Tower</cite> is not so good, though it is thought better by the multitude.
That is, there is a subject—something to talk about; but in fact, the
expression is not that of grief, or thought, or of dignified resignation,
but of a man in ill health. Vandyke was a mere portrait-painter, but
he was a perfect one. His <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i> was not the romantic or pathetic;
he was ‘of the court, courtly.’ He had a patent from the hand of
nature to paint lords and ladies in prosperity and quite at their ease.
There are some portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds in this Collection;
and there are people who persist in naming him and Vandyke in the
same day. The rest of the Collection consists (for the most part) of
<em>staircase</em> and family pictures. But there are some admirable statues
to be seen here, that it would ask a morning’s leisure to study
properly.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>PICTURES AT BURLEIGH HOUSE<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Burleigh! thy groves are leafless, thy walls are naked—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And dull, cold winter does inhabit here.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The yellow evening rays gleam through thy fretted Gothic windows;
but I only feel the rustling of withered branches strike chill to my
breast; it was not so twenty years ago. Thy groves were leafless
then as now: it was the middle of winter twice that I visited thee
before; but the lark mounted in the sky, and the sun smote my
youthful blood with its slant ray, and the ploughman whistled as he
drove his team afield; Hope spread out its glad vistas through thy
fair domains, oh, Burleigh! Fancy decked thy walls with works of
sovereign art, and it was spring, not winter, in my breast. All is
still the same, like a petrification of the mind—the same things in
the same places; but their effect is not the same upon me. I am
twenty years the worse for <em>wear and tear</em>. What is become of the
never-ending studious thoughts that brought their own reward or
promised good to mankind? of the tears that started welcome and
unbidden? of the sighs that whispered future peace? of the smiles
that shone, not in my face indeed, but that cheered my heart, and
made a sunshine there when all was gloom around? That fairy
vision—that invisible glory, by which I was once attended—ushered
into life, has left my side, and ‘faded to the light of common day,’
and I now see what is, or has been—not what may lie hid in Time’s
bright circle and golden chaplet! Perhaps this is the characteristic
difference between youth and a later period of life—that we, by
degrees, learn to take things more as we find them, call them more
by their right names; that we feel the warmth of summer, but the
winter’s cold as well; that we see beauties, but can spy defects in the
fairest face; and no longer look at every thing through the genial
atmosphere of our own existence. We grow more literal and less
credulous every day, lose much enjoyment, and gain some useful, and
more useless knowledge. The second time I passed along the road
that skirts Burleigh Park, the morning was dank and ‘ways were
mire.’ I saw and felt it not: my mind was otherwise engaged.
Ah! thought I, there is that fine old head by Rembrandt; there
within those cold grey walls, the painter of old age is enshrined,
immortalized in some of his inimitable works! The name of
Rembrandt lives in the fame of him who stamped it with renown,
while the name of Burleigh is kept up by the present owner. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>artist survives in the issue of his brain to all posterity—a lord is
nothing without the issue of his body lawfully begotten, and is lost
in a long line of illustrious ancestors. So much higher is genius than
rank—such is the difference between fame and title! A great name
in art lasts for centuries—it requires twenty generations of a noble
house to keep alive the memory of the first founder for the same
length of time. So I reasoned, and was not a little proud of my
discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this dreaming mood, dreaming of deathless works and deathless
names, I went on to Peterborough, passing, as it were, under an
arch-way of Fame,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>——‘and still walking under,</div>
      <div class='line'>Found some new matter to look up and wonder.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I had business there: I will not say what. I could at this time do
nothing. I could not write a line—I could not draw a stroke. ‘I
was brutish;’ though not ‘like warlike as the wolf, nor subtle as the
fox for prey.’ In words, in looks, in deeds, I was no better than a
changeling. Why then do I set so much value on my existence
formerly? Oh God! that I could but be for one day, one hour, nay
but for an instant, (to feel it in all the plentitude of unconscious bliss,
and take one long, last, lingering draught of that full brimming cup of
thoughtless freedom,) what then I was—that I might, as in a trance,
a waking dream, hear the hoarse murmur of the bargemen, as the
Minster tower appeared in the dim twilight, come up from the willowy
stream, sounding low and underground like the voice of the bittern—that
I might paint that field opposite the window where I lived, and
feel that there was a green, dewy moisture in the tone, beyond my
pencil’s reach, but thus gaining almost a new sense, and watching the
birth of new objects without me—that I might stroll down Peterborough
bank, (a winter’s day,) and see the fresh marshes stretching
out in endless level perspective, (as if Paul Potter had painted them,)
with the cattle, the windmills, and the red-tiled cottages, gleaming in
the sun to the very verge of the horizon, and watch the fieldfares in
innumerable flocks, gamboling in the air, and sporting in the sun, and
racing before the clouds, making summersaults, and dazzling the eye
by throwing themselves into a thousand figures and movements—that
I might go, as then, a pilgrimage to the town where my mother was
born, and visit the poor farm-house where she was brought up, and
lean upon the gate where she told me she used to stand when a child
of ten years old and look at the setting sun!—I could do all this
still; but with different feelings. As our hopes leave us, we lose even
our interest and regrets for the past. I had at this time, simple as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>seemed, many resources. I could in some sort ‘play at bowls with
the sun and moon;’ or, at any rate, there was no question in metaphysics
that I could not bandy to and fro, as one might play at
cup-and-ball, for twenty, thirty, forty miles of the great North Road,
and at it again, the next day, as fresh as ever. I soon get tired of
this now, and wonder how I managed formerly. I knew Tom Jones
by heart, and was deep in Peregrine Pickle. I was intimately
acquainted with all the heroes and heroines of Richardson’s romances,
and could turn from one to the other as I pleased. I could con over
that single passage in Pamela about ‘her lumpish heart,’ and never
have done admiring the skill of the author and the truth of nature.
I had my sports and recreations too, some such as these following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To see the sun to bed, and to arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like some hot amourist, with glowing eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Bursting the lazy bands of sleep that bound him,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all his fires and travelling glories round him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes the moon on soft night clouds to rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like beauty nestling in a young man’s breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all the winking stars, her handmaids, keep</div>
      <div class='line'>Admiring silence while those lovers sleep.</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes outstretcht, in very idleness,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nought doing, saying little, thinking less,</div>
      <div class='line'>To view the leaves, thin dancers upon air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go eddying round and small birds how they fare,</div>
      <div class='line'>When Mother Autumn fills their beaks with corn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Filch’d from the careless Amalthea’s horn:</div>
      <div class='line'>And how the woods berries and worms provide</div>
      <div class='line'>Without their pains, when earth has nought beside</div>
      <div class='line'>To answer their small wants.</div>
      <div class='line'>To view the graceful deer come tripping by,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then stop and gaze, then turn, they know not why,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like bashful younkers in society.</div>
      <div class='line'>To mark the structure of a plant or tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all fair things of earth, how fair they be.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I have wandered far enough from Burleigh House; but I had
some associations about it which I could not well get rid of, without
troubling the reader with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Rembrandts</em> disappointed me quite. I could hardly find a
trace of the impression which had been inlaid in my imagination. I
might as well</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Instead of broken wrinkles and indented flesh, I saw hard lines and
stained canvas. I had seen better Rembrandts since, and had learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>to see nature better. Was it a disadvantage, then, that for twenty
years I had carried this fine idea in my brain, enriching it from time
to time from my observations of nature or art, and raising it as they
were raised; or did it much signify that it was disturbed at last?
Neither. The picture was nothing to me: it was the idea it had
suggested. The one hung on the wall at Burleigh; the other was an
heir-loom in my mind. Was it destroyed, because the picture, after
long absence, did not answer to it? No. There were other pictures
in the world that did, and objects in nature still more perfect. This
is the melancholy privilege of art; it exists chiefly in idea, and is not
liable to serious reverses. If we are disappointed in the character of
one we love, it breaks the illusion altogether; for we drew certain
consequences from a face. If an old friendship is broken up, we
cannot tell how to replace it, without the aid of habit and a length of
time. But a picture is nothing but a face; it interests us only in idea.
Hence we need never be afraid of raising our standard of taste too
high; for the mind rises with it, exalted and refined, and can never
be much injured by finding out its casual mistakes. Like the possessor
of a splendid collection, who is indifferent to or turns away from
common pictures, we have a selector gallery in our own minds. In
this sense, the knowledge of art is <em>its own exceeding great reward</em>.
But is there not danger that we may become too fastidious, and have
nothing left to admire? None: for the conceptions of the human
soul cannot rise superior to the power of art; or if they do, then we
have surely every reason to be satisfied with them. The mind, in
what depends upon itself alone, ‘soon rises from defeat unhurt,’
though its pride may be for a moment ‘humbled by such rebuke,’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And in its liquid texture mortal wound</div>
      <div class='line'>Receives no more than can the fluid air.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As an illustration of the same thing, there are two Claudes at
Burleigh, which certainly do not come up to the celebrity of the
artist’s name. They did not please me formerly: the sky, the water,
the trees seemed all too blue, too much of the colour of indigo. But I
believed, and wondered. I could no longer admire these specimens
of the artist at present, but assuredly my admiration of the artist himself
was not less than before; for since then, I had seen other works
by the same hand,</p>

<p class='c000'>surpassing every idea that the mind could form of art, except by
having seen them. I remember one in particular that Walsh Porter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>had (a bow-shot beyond all others)—a vernal landscape, an ‘Hesperian
fable true,’ with a blue unclouded sky, and green trees and
grey turrets and an unruffled sea beyond. But never was there sky
so soft or trees so clad with spring, such air-drawn towers or such
halcyon seas: Zephyr seemed to fan the air, and Nature looked on
and smiled. The name of Claude has alone something in it that
softens and harmonises the mind. It touches a magic chord. Oh!
matchless scenes, oh! orient skies, bright with purple and gold; ye
opening glades and distant sunny vales, glittering with fleecy flocks,
pour all your enchantment into my soul, let it reflect your chastened
image, and forget all meaner things! Perhaps the most affecting
tribute to the memory of this great artist is the character drawn of
him by an eminent master, in his <cite>Dream of a Painter</cite>.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘On a sudden I was surrounded by a thick cloud or mist, and my guide
wafted me through the air, till we alighted on a most delicious rural spot.
I perceived it was the early hour of the morn, when the sun had not risen
above the horizon. We were alone, except that at a little distance a
young shepherd played on his flageolet as he walked before his herd,
conducting them from the fold to the pasture. The elevated pastoral air
he played charmed me by its simplicity, and seemed to animate his obedient
flock. The atmosphere was clear and perfectly calm: and now the rising
sun gradually illumined the fine landscape, and began to discover to our
view the distant country of immense extent. I stood awhile in expectation
of what might next present itself of dazzling splendour, when the only
object which appeared to fill this natural, grand, and simple scene, was a
rustic who entered, not far from the place where we stood, who by his
habiliments seemed nothing better than a peasant; he led a poor little ass,
which was loaded with all the implements required by a painter in his work.
After advancing a few paces he stood still, and with an air of rapture
seemed to contemplate the rising sun: he next fell on his knees, directed
his eyes towards heaven, crossed himself, and then went on with eager
looks, as if to make choice of the most advantageous spot from which to
make his studies as a painter. “This,” said my conductor, “is that
Claude Gelée of Lorraine, who, nobly disdaining the low employment to
which he was originally bred, left it with all its advantages of competence
and ease to embrace his present state of poverty, in order to adorn the
world with works of most accomplished excellence.”’</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a little Paul Brill at Burleigh, in the same room with the
Rembrandts, that dazzled me many years ago, and delighted me the
other day. It looked as sparkling as if the sky came through
the frame. I found, or fancied I found, those pictures the best that
I remembered before, though they might in the interval have faded a
little to my eyes, or lost some of their original brightness. I did not
see the small head of Queen Mary by Holbein, which formerly struck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>me so forcibly; but I have little doubt respecting it, for Holbein was
a sure hand; he only wanted effect, and this picture looked through
you. One of my old favourites was the <cite>Head of an Angel</cite>, by Guido,
nearly a profile, looking up, and with wings behind the back. It was
hung lower than it used to be, and had, I thought, a look less aërial,
less heavenly; but there was still a pulpy softness in it, a tender grace,
an expression unutterable—which only the pencil, <em>his</em> pencil, could
convey! And are we not then beholden to the art for these glimpses
of Paradise? Surely, there is a sweetness in Guido’s heads, as there
is also a music in his name. If Raphael did more, it was not with the
same ease. His heads have more meaning; but Guido’s have a look
of youthful innocence, which his are without. As to the boasted
picture of Christ by Carlo Dolce, if a well-painted table-cloth and
silver-cup are worth three thousand guineas, the picture is so, but not
else. Yet one touch of Paul Veronese is worth all this enamelling
twice over. The head has a wretched mawkish expression, utterly
unbecoming the character it professes to represent. But I will say no
more about it. The <cite>Bath of Seneca</cite> is one of Luca Jordano’s best
performances, and has considerable interest and effect. Among other
historical designs, there is one of <cite>Jacob’s Dream</cite>, with the angels
ascending and descending on a kind of stairs. The conception is
very answerable to the subject; but the execution is not in any high
degree spirited or graceful. The mind goes away no gainer from the
picture. Rembrandt alone perhaps could add any thing to this
subject. Of him it might be said, that ‘his light shone in darkness!’—The
wreaths of flowers and foliage carved in wood on the wainscots
and ceiling of many of the rooms, by the celebrated Grinling Gibbons
in Charles the Second’s time, shew a wonderful lightness and facility
of hand, and give pleasure to the eye. The other ornaments and
curiosities I need not mention, as they are carefully pointed out by
the housekeeper to the admiring visitor. There are two heads, however,
(one of them happens to have a screen placed before it) which I
would by no means wish any one to pass over, who is an artist, or
feels the slightest interest in the art. They are, I should suppose
unquestionably, the original studies by Raphael of the heads of the
<cite>Virgin</cite> and <cite>Joseph</cite> in his famous picture of the <cite>Madonna of the Crown</cite>.
The Virgin is particularly beautiful, and in the finest preservation, as
indeed are all his genuine pictures. The canvas is not quite covered
in some places; the colours are as fresh as if newly laid on, and the
execution is as firm and vigorous as if his hand had just left it. It
shews us how this artist wrought. The head is, no doubt, a highly-finished
study from nature, done for a particular purpose, and worked
up according to the painter’s conception, but still retaining all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>force and truth of individuality. He got all he could from Nature,
and gave all he could to her in return. If Raphael had merely
sketched this divine face on the canvas from the idea in his own
mind, why not stamp it on the larger composition at once? He
could work it up and refine upon it there just as well, and it would
almost necessarily undergo some alteration in being transferred thither
afterwards. But if it was done as a careful copy from Nature in the
first instance, the present was the only way in which he could proceed,
or indeed by which he could arrive at such consummate excellence.
The head of the Joseph (leaning on the hand and looking down) is
fine, but neither so fine as the companion to it, nor is it by any means
so elaborately worked up in the sketch before us.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am no teller of stories; but there is one belonging to Burleigh-House,
of which I happen to know some of the particulars. The
late Earl of Exeter had been divorced from his first wife, a woman
of fashion, and of somewhat more gaiety of manners than ‘lords who
love their ladies like.’ He determined to seek out a second wife in
an humbler sphere of life, and that it should be one who, having no
knowledge of his rank, should love him for himself alone. For this
purpose, he went and settled <em>incognito</em> (under the name of Mr. Jones)
at Hodnet, an obscure village in Shropshire. He made overtures to
one or two damsels in the neighbourhood, but they were too knowing
to be taken in by him. His manners were not boorish, his mode of
life was retired, it was odd how he got his livelihood, and at last, he
began to be taken for a highwayman. In this dilemma he turned to
Miss Hoggins, the eldest daughter of a small farmer, at whose house
he lodged. Miss Hoggins, it might seem, had not been used to
romp with the clowns: there was something in the manners of their
quiet, but eccentric guest that she liked. As he found that he had
inspired her with that kind of regard which he wished for, he made
honourable proposals to her, and at the end of some months, they
were married, without his letting her know who he was. They set
off in a post-chaise from her father’s house, and travelled homewards
across the country. In this manner they arrived at Stamford, and
passed through the town without stopping, till they came to the
entrance of Burleigh-Park, which is on the outside of it. The gates
flew open, the chaise entered, and drove down the long avenue of
trees that leads up to the front of this fine old mansion. As they
drew nearer to it, and she seemed a little surprised where they were
going, he said, ‘Well, my dear, this is Burleigh-House; it is the
home I have promised to bring you to, and you are the Countess of
Exeter!’ It is said, the shock of this discovery was too much for
this young creature, and that she never recovered it. It was a sensation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>worth dying for. The world we live in was worth making, had
it been only for this. <cite>Ye Thousand and One Tales of the Arabian
Night’s Entertainment!</cite> hide your diminished heads! I never wish
to have been a lord, but when I think of this story.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>PICTURES AT OXFORD AND BLENHEIM</h3>

<p class='c008'>Rome has been called the ‘Sacred City:’—might not <em>our</em> Oxford
be called so too? There is an air about it, resonant of joy and hope:
it speaks with a thousand tongues to the heart: it waves its mighty
shadow over the imagination: it stands in lowly sublimity, on the
‘hill of ages;’ and points with prophetic fingers to the sky: it greets
the eager gaze from afar, ‘with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,’
that shine with an internal light as with the lustre of setting suns; and
a dream and a glory hover round its head, as the spirits of former
times, a throng of intellectual shapes, are seen retreating or advancing
to the eye of memory: its streets are paved with the names of learning
that can never wear out: its green quadrangles breathe the silence of
thought, conscious of the weight of yearnings innumerable after the
past, of loftiest aspirations for the future: Isis babbles of the Muse,
its waters are from the springs of Helicon, its Christ-Church meadows,
classic, Elysian fields!—We could pass our lives in Oxford without
having or wanting any other idea—that of the place is enough. We
imbibe the air of thought; we stand in the presence of learning. We
are admitted into the Temple of Fame, we feel that we are in the
sanctuary, on holy ground, and ‘hold high converse with the mighty
dead.’ The enlightened and the ignorant are on a level, if they have
but faith in the tutelary genius of the place. We may be wise by
proxy, and studious by prescription. Time has taken upon himself
the labour of thinking; and accumulated libraries leave us leisure to
be dull. There is no occasion to examine the buildings, the churches,
the colleges, by the rules of architecture, to reckon up the streets, to
compare it with Cambridge (Cambridge lies out of the way, on one
side of the world)—but woe to him who does not feel in passing
through Oxford that he is in ‘no mean city,’ that he is surrounded
with the monuments and lordly mansions of the mind of man, outvying
in pomp and splendour the courts and palaces of princes, rising
like an exhalation in the night of ignorance, and triumphing over
barbaric foes, saying, ‘All eyes shall see me, and all knees shall bow
to me!’—as the shrine where successive ages came to pay their pious
vows, and slake the sacred thirst of knowledge, where youthful hopes
(an endless flight) soared to truth and good, and where the retired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and lonely student brooded over the historic or over fancy’s page,
imposing high tasks for himself, framing high destinies for the race
of man—the lamp, the mine, the well-head from whence the spark
of learning was kindled, its stream flowed, its treasures were spread
out through the remotest corners of the land and to distant nations.
Let him then who is fond of indulging in a dream-like existence go
to Oxford and stay there; let him study this magnificent spectacle,
the same under all aspects, with its mental twilight tempering the
glare of noon, or mellowing the silver moonlight; let him wander in
her sylvan suburbs, or linger in her cloistered halls; but let him not
catch the din of scholars or teachers, or dine or sup with them, or
speak a word to any of the privileged inhabitants; for if he does, the
spell will be broken, the poetry and the religion gone, and the palace
of enchantment will melt from his embrace into thin air!</p>

<p class='c000'>The only Collection of Pictures at Oxford is that at the Radcliffe
Library; bequeathed by Sir William Guise. It is so far appropriate
that it is dingy, solemn, old; and we would gladly leave it to its
repose; but where criticism comes, affection ‘clappeth his wings,
and straightway he is gone.’ Most of the pictures are either copies,
or spoiled, or never were good for any thing. There is, however, a
<cite>Music Piece</cite> by Titian, which bears the stamp of his hand, and is
‘majestic, though in ruins.’ It represents three young ladies
practising at a harpsichord, with their music-master looking on. One
of the girls is tall, with prominent features seen in profile, but
exquisitely fair, and with a grave expression; the other is a lively,
good-humoured girl, in a front view; and the third leans forward
from behind, looking down with a demure, reserved, sentimental cast
of countenance, but very pretty, and much like an English face.
The teacher has a manly, intelligent countenance, with a certain
blended air of courtesy and authority. It is a fascinating picture,
to our thinking; and has that marked characteristic look, belonging
to each individual and to the subject, which is always to be found in
Titian’s groups. We also noticed a dingy, melancholy-looking Head
over the window of the farthest room, said to be a <cite>Portrait of
Vandyke</cite>, with something striking in the tone and expression; and a
small <cite>Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise</cite>, attributed to Giuseppe
Ribera, which has considerable merit. The amateur will here find
continual copies (of an indifferent class) of many of his old favourite
pictures of the Italian school, Titian, Domenichino, Correggio, and
others. But the most valuable part of the Collection consists of four
undoubted Heads cut out of one of the <cite>Cartoons</cite>, which was destroyed
by fire about a hundred years ago: they are here preserved in their
pristine integrity. They shew us what the Cartoons were. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>have all the spirit and freedom of Raphael’s hand, but without any
of the blotches and smearing of those at Hampton Court; with
which the damp of outhouses and the dews of heaven have evidently
had nearly as much to do as the painter. Two are Heads of men,
and two of women; one of the last, <cite>Rachel weeping for her Children</cite>,
and another still finer (both are profiles) in which all the force and
boldness of masculine understanding is combined with feminine softness
of expression. The large, ox-like eye, a ‘lucid mirror,’ with
the eye-lids drooping, and the long eye-lashes distinctly marked, the
straight scrutinizing nose, the full, but closed lips, the matronly chin
and high forehead, altogether convey a character of matured thought
and expansive feeling, such as is seldom to be met with. <cite>Rachel
weeping for her Children</cite> has a sterner and more painful, but a very
powerful expression. It is heroic, rather than pathetic. The Heads
of the men are spirited and forcible, but they are distinguished chiefly
by the firmness of the outline, and the sharpness and mastery of the
execution.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Blenheim is not inferior in waving woods and sloping lawns and

</div>

<p class='c000'>But as a receptacle for works of art, (with the exception of Cleveland
House,) it is unrivalled in this country. There is not a bad picture
in it: the interest is sustained by rich and noble performances from
first to last. It abounds in Rubens’ works. The old Duchess of
Marlborough was fond of the historical pieces of this great painter;
she had, during her husband’s wars and negociations in Flanders, a
fine opportunity of culling them, ‘as one picks pears, saying, this I
like, that I like still better:’ and from the selection she has made,
it appears as if she understood the master’s genius well. She has
chosen those of his works which were most mellow, and at the same
time gorgeous in colouring, most luxuriant in composition, most
unctuous in expression. Rubens was the only artist that could have
embodied some of our countryman Spenser’s splendid and voluptuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>allegories. If a painter among ourselves were to attempt a <span class='sc'>Spenser
Gallery</span>, (perhaps the finest subject for the pencil in the world after
Heathen mythology and Scripture History,) he ought to go and
study the principles of his design at Blenheim!—The <cite>Silenus</cite> and the
<cite>Rape of Proserpine</cite> contain more of the Bacchanalian and lawless
spirit of ancient fable than perhaps any two pictures extant. We
shall not dispute that Nicolas Poussin could probably give more of
the abstract, metaphysical character of his traditional personages, or
that Titian could set them off better, so as to ‘leave stings’ in the
eye of the spectator, by a prodigious <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> of colouring, as in his
<cite>Bacchus and Ariadne</cite>: but neither of them gave the same undulating
outline, the same humid, <em>pulpy</em> tone to the flesh, the same graceful
involution to the grouping and the forms, the same animal spirits, the
same breathing motion. Let any one look at the figure of the <cite>Silenus</cite>
in the first-mentioned of these compositions, its unwieldy size, its
reeling, drunken attitude, its capacity for revelling in gross, sensual
enjoyment, and contrast it with the figure of the nymph, so light, so
wanton, so fair, that her clear crystal skin and laughing grace spread
a ruddy glow, and account for the giddy tumult all around her; and
say if any thing finer in this kind was ever executed or imagined.
In that sort of licentious fancy, in which a certain grossness of
expression bordered on caricature, and where grotesque or enticing
form was to be combined with free and rapid movements, or different
tones and colours were to be flung over the picture as in sport or in
a dance, no one ever surpassed the Flemish painter; and some of the
greatest triumphs of his pencil are to be found in the Blenheim
Gallery. There are several others of his best pictures on sacred
subjects, such as the <cite>Flight into Egypt</cite>, and the illustration of the
text, ‘Suffer little children to come unto me.’ The head and figure
and deportment of the Christ, in this last admirable production, are
nobly characteristic (beyond what the painter usually accomplished
in this department)—the face of a woman holding a young child,
pale, pensive, with scarce any shadow, and the head of the child
itself (looking as vacant and satisfied as if the nipple had just dropped
from its mouth) are actually alive. Those who can look at this
picture with indifference, or without astonishment at the truth of
nature, and the felicity of execution, may rest assured that they know
as little of Rubens as of the Art itself. Vandyke, the scholar and
rival of Rubens, holds the next place in this Collection. There is
here, as in so many other places, a picture of the famous Lord
Strafford, with his Secretary—both speaking heads, and with the
characters finely diversified. We were struck also by the delightful
family picture of the Duchess of Buckingham and her Children, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>not so much (we confess it) as we expected from our recollection of
this picture a few years ago. It had less the effect of a perfect
mirror of fashion in ‘the olden time,’ than we fancied to ourselves—the
little girl had less exquisite primness and studied gentility, the
little boy had not the same chubby, good-humoured look, and the
colours in his cheek had faded—nor had the mother the same graceful,
matron-like air. Is it we or the picture that has changed? In
general our expectations tally pretty well with our after-observations,
but there was a falling-off in the present instance. There is a fine
whole-length of a lady of quality of that day (we think Lady
Cleveland); but the master-piece of Vandyke’s pencil here is his
<cite>Charles I. on Horseback</cite>. It is the famous cream or fawn-coloured
horse, which, of all the creatures that ever were painted, is surely one
of the most beautiful.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Its steps are delicate, as if it moved to some soft measure or courtly
strain, or disdained the very ground it trod upon; its form all lightness
and elegance: the expression quick and fiery; the colour
inimitable; the texture of the skin sensitive and tremblingly alive all
over, as if it would shrink from the smallest touch. The portrait of
Charles is not equal; but there is a landscape-background, which in
breezy freshness seems almost to rival the airy spirit and delicacy of
the noble animal. There are also one or two fine Rembrandts
(particularly a <cite>Jacob and Esau</cite>)—an early Raphael, the <cite>Adoration</cite> of
some saint, hard and stiff, but carefully designed; and a fine, sensible,
graceful head of the <cite>Fornarina</cite>, of which we have a common and
well-executed engraving.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘But did you see the Titian room?’—Yes, we did, and a glorious
treat it was; nor do we know why it should not be shewn to every
one. There is nothing alarming but the title of the subjects—<cite>The
Loves of the Gods</cite>—just as was the case with Mr. T. Moore’s <cite>Loves
of the Angels</cite>—but oh! how differently treated! What a gusto in
the first, compared with the insipidity of the last! What streaks of
living blood-colour, so unlike gauze spangles or pink silk-stockings!
What union, what symmetry of form, instead of sprawling, flimsy
descriptions—what an expression of amorous enjoyment about the
mouth, the eyes, and even to the finger-ends, instead of cold conceits,
and moonlight similes! This is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>; so to our task.—It is
said these pictures were discovered in an old lumber-room by Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Joshua Reynolds, who set a high value on them, and that they are
undoubtedly by Titian, having been originally sent over as a present
by the King of Sardinia (for whose ancestor they were painted) to
the first Duke of Marlborough. We should (without, however,
pretending to set up an opinion) incline, from the internal evidence,
to think them from the pencil of the great Venetian, but for two
circumstances: the first is the texture of the skin; and secondly,
they do not compose well as pictures. They have no back-ground
to set them off, but a most ridiculous trellis-work, representing nothing,
hung round them; and the flesh looks monotonous and hard, like the
rind of fruit. On the other hand, this last objection seems to be
answered satisfactorily enough, and without impugning the skill of
the artist; for the pictures are actually painted on skins of leather.
In all other respects, they might assuredly be by Titian, and we
know of no other painter who was capable of achieving their various
excellences. The drawing of the female figures is correct and
elegant in a high degree, and might be supposed to be borrowed from
classic sculpture, but that it is more soft, more feminine, more lovely.
The colouring, with the exception already stated, is true, spirited,
golden, harmonious. The grouping and attitudes are heroic, the
expression in some of the faces divine. We do not mean, of course,
that it possesses the elevation or purity that Raphael or Correggio
could give, but it is warmer, more thrilling and ecstatic. There is
the glow and ripeness of a more genial clime, the purple light of love,
crimsoned blushes, looks bathed in rapture, kisses with immortal
sweetness in their taste—Nay, then, let the reader go and see the
pictures, and no longer lay the blame of this extravagance on us.
We may at any rate repeat the subjects. They are eight in number.
1. <cite>Mars and Venus.</cite> The Venus is well worthy to be called the
Queen of Love, for shape, for air, for every thing. Her redoubted
lover is a middle-aged, ill-looking gentleman, clad in a buff-jerkin, and
somewhat of a formalist in his approaches and mode of address; but
there is a Cupid playing on the floor, who might well turn the world
upside down. 2. <cite>Cupid and Psyche.</cite> The Cupid is perhaps rather a
gawky, awkward stripling, with eager, open-mouthed wonder: but
did ever creature of mortal mould see any thing comparable to the
back and limbs of the Psyche, or conceive or read any thing equal to
it, but that unique description in the Troilus and Cressida of Chaucer?
3. <cite>Apollo and Daphne.</cite> Not equal to the rest. 4. <cite>Hercules and
Dejanira.</cite> The female figure in this picture is full of grace and
animation, and the arms that are twined round the great son of Jove
are elastic as a bended bow. 5. <cite>Vulcan and Ceres.</cite> 6. <cite>Pluto and
Proserpine.</cite> 7. <cite>Jupiter and Io.</cite> Very fine. And finest of all, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>last, <cite>Neptune and Amphitrite</cite>. In this last work it seems ‘as if
increase of appetite did grow with what it fed on.’ What a face is
that of Amphitrite for beauty and for sweetness of expression! One
thing is remarkable in these groups (with the exception of two)
which is that the lovers are all of them old men; but then they
retain their beards (according to the custom of the good old times!)
and this makes not only a picturesque contrast, but gives a beautiful
softness and youthful delicacy to the female faces opposed to them.
Upon the whole, this series of historic compositions well deserves the
attention of the artist and the connoisseur, and perhaps some light
might be thrown upon the subject of their authenticity by turning
over some old portfolios. We have heard a hint thrown out that
the designs are of a date prior to Titian. But ‘we are ignorance
itself in this!’</p>

<h3 class='c003'>APPENDIX</h3>

<p class='c008'>CRITICISM
ON HOGARTH’S MARRIAGE A-LA-MODE</p>

<p class='c016'><em>The Criticism on Hogarth’s ‘Marriage a-la-Mode,’ referred to in the
account of Mr. Angerstein’s pictures (page <a href='#Page_15'>15</a>), is as follows</em>:—</p>

<p class='c000'>The superiority of the pictures of Hogarth, which we have seen
in the late collection at the British Institution, to the common prints,
is confined chiefly to the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite>. We shall attempt to
illustrate a few of their most striking excellences, more particularly
with reference to the expression of character. Their merits are
indeed so prominent, and have been so often discussed, that it may
be thought difficult to point out any new beauties; but they contain
so much truth of nature, they present the objects to the eye under
so many aspects and bearings, admit of so many constructions, and
are so pregnant with meaning, that the subject is in a manner
inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Boccaccio, the most refined and sentimental of all the novel-writers,
has been stigmatized as a mere inventor of licentious tales, because
readers in general have only seized on those things in his works which
were suited to their own taste, and have reflected their own grossness
back upon the writer. So it has happened that the majority of critics
having been most struck with the strong and decided expression in
Hogarth, the extreme delicacy and subtle gradations of character
in his pictures have almost entirely escaped them. In the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>picture of the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite>, the three figures of the young
Nobleman, his intended Bride, and her <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">innamorato</span> the Lawyer,
shew how much Hogarth excelled in the power of giving soft and
effeminate expression. They have, however, been less noticed than
the other figures, which tell a plainer story, and convey a more
palpable moral. Nothing can be more finely managed than the
differences of character in these delicate personages. The Beau sits
smiling at the looking-glass, with a reflected simper of self-admiration,
and a languishing inclination of the head, while the rest of his body
is perked up on his high heels, with a certain air of tiptoe elevation.
He is the Narcissus of the reign of George <span class='fss'>II.</span>, whose powdered
peruke, ruffles, gold lace, and patches, divide his self-love equally
with his own person, the true Sir Plume of his day,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Of amber snuff-box justly vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the nice conduct of a clouded cane.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is the same felicity in the figure and attitude of the Bride,
courted by the Lawyer. There is the utmost flexibility, and
yielding softness in her whole person, a listless languor and tremulous
suspense in the expression of her face. It is the precise look and
air which Pope has given to his favourite Belinda, just at the moment
of the Rape of the Lock. The heightened glow, the forward intelligence,
and loosened soul of love in the same face, in the Assignation-scene
before the masquerade, form a fine and instructive contrast
to the delicacy, timidity, and coy reluctance expressed in the first.
The Lawyer, in both pictures, is much the same—perhaps too much
so—though even this unmoved, unaltered appearance may be designed
as characteristic. In both cases, he has ‘a person and a smooth
dispose, framed to make women false.’ He is full of that easy
good-humour, and easy good opinion of himself, with which the sex
are delighted. There is not a sharp angle in his face to obstruct his
success, or give a hint of doubt or difficulty. His whole aspect is
round and rosy, lively and unmeaning, happy without the least expense
of thought, careless, and inviting; and conveys a perfect idea of the
uninterrupted glide and pleasing murmur of the soft periods that flow
from his tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The expression of the Bride in the Morning-scene is the most
highly seasoned, and at the same time the most vulgar in the series.
The figure, face, and attitude of the Husband are inimitable. Hogarth
has with great skill contrasted the pale countenance of the Husband
with the yellow whitish colour of the marble chimney-piece behind
him, in such a manner as to preserve the fleshy tone of the former.
The airy splendour of the view of the inner room in this picture,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>is probably not exceeded by any of the productions of the Flemish
school.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Young Girl, in the third picture, who is represented as a
victim of fashionable profligacy, is unquestionably one of the artist’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i>. The exquisite delicacy of the painting is only surpassed
by the felicity and subtlety of the conception. Nothing can
be more striking than the contrast between the extreme softness of
her person and the hardened indifference of her character. The
vacant stillness, the docility to vice, the premature suppression of
youthful sensibility, the doll-like mechanism of the whole figure,
which seems to have no other feeling but a sickly sense of pain,—shew
the deepest insight into human nature, and into the effects
of those refinements in depravity, by which it has been good-naturedly
asserted, that ‘vice loses half its evil in losing all its
grossness.’ The story of this picture is in some parts very obscure
and enigmatical. It is certain that the Nobleman is not looking
straight forward to the Quack, whom he seems to have been threatening
with his cane; but that his eyes are turned up with an ironical
leer of triumph to the Procuress. The commanding attitude and
size of this woman,—the swelling circumference of her dress, spread
out like a turkey-cock’s feathers,—the fierce, ungovernable, inveterate
malignity of her countenance, which hardly needs the comment of
the clasp-knife to explain her purpose, are all admirable in themselves,
and still more so, as they are opposed to the mute insensibility, the
elegant negligence of dress, and the childish figure of the girl, who
is supposed to be her <em>protegée</em>. As for the Quack, there can be no
doubt entertained about him. His face seems as if it were composed
of salve, and his features exhibit all the chaos and confusion of the
most gross, ignorant, and impudent empiricism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gradations of ridiculous affectation in the Music-scene, are
finely imagined and preserved. The preposterous, overstrained
admiration of the Lady of Quality; the sentimental, insipid, patient,
delight of the Man with his hair in papers, and sipping his tea;
the pert, smirking, conceited, half-distorted approbation of the figure
next to him; the transition to the total insensibility of the round
face in profile, and then to the wonder of the Negro-boy at the
rapture of his mistress,—form a perfect whole. The sanguine
complexion and flame-coloured hair of the female Virtuoso throw
an additional light on the character. This is lost in the print.
The continuing the red colour of the hair into the back of the
chair, has been pointed out as one of those instances of alliteration
in colouring, of which these pictures are everywhere full. The
gross, bloated appearance of the Italian Singer is well relieved by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the hard features of the instrumental Performer behind him, which
might be carved of wood. The Negro-boy, holding the chocolate,
in expression, colour, and execution, is a master-piece. The gay,
lively derision of the other Negro-boy, playing with the Actæon, is
an ingenious contrast to the profound amazement of the first. Some
account has already been given of the two lovers in this picture.
It is curious to observe the infinite activity of mind which the artist
displays on every occasion. An instance occurs in the present picture.
He has so contrived the papers in the hair of the Bride, as to make
them look almost like a wreathe of half-blown flowers; while those
which he has placed on the head of the musical Amateur very much
resemble a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-fris</span></i> of horns, which adorn and fortify the lacklustre
expression and mild resignation of the face beneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Night-scene is inferior to the rest of the series. The attitude
of the Husband, who is just killed, is one in which it would be
impossible for him to stand, or even to fall. It resembles the loose
pasteboard figures they make for children. The characters in the
last picture, in which the Wife dies, are all masterly. We would
particularly refer to the captious, petulant self-sufficiency of the
Apothecary, whose face and figure are constructed on exact physiognomical
principles, and to the fine example of passive obedience and
non-resistance in the Servant, whom he is taking to task, and whose
coat of green and yellow livery is as long and melancholy as his face.
The disconsolate look, the haggard eyes, the open mouth, the comb
sticking in the hair, the broken, gapped teeth, which, as it were,
hitch in an answer—every thing about him denotes the utmost
perplexity and dismay. The harmony and gradations of colour in
this picture are uniformly preserved with the greatest nicety, and
are well worthy the attention of the artist.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been observed, that Hogarth’s pictures are exceedingly
unlike any other representations of the same kind of subjects—that
they form a class, and have a character, peculiar to themselves.
It may be worth while to consider in what this general distinction
consists.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place they are, in the strictest sense, historical pictures;
and if what Fielding says be true, that his novel of Tom Jones ought
to be regarded as an epic prose-poem, because it contained a regular
developement of fable, manners, character, and passion, the compositions
of Hogarth will, in like manner be found to have a higher claim
to the title of Epic Pictures, than many which have of late arrogated
that denomination to themselves. When we say that Hogarth treated
his subjects historically, we mean that his works represent the manners
and humours of mankind in action, and their characters by varying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>expression. Every thing in his pictures has life and motion in it.
Not only does the business of the scene never stand still, but every
feature and muscle is put into full play; the exact feeling of the
moment is brought out, and carried to its utmost height, and then
instantly seized and stamped on the canvas forever. The expression
is always taken <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, in a state of progress or change, and, as it
were, at the salient point. Besides the excellence of each individual
face, the reflection of the expression from face to face, the contrast
and struggle of particular motives and feelings in the different actors
in the scene, as of anger, contempt, laughter, compassion, are conveyed
in the happiest and most lively manner. His figures are not like the
background on which they are painted: even the pictures on the wall
have a peculiar look of their own.—Again, with the rapidity, variety,
and scope of history, Hogarth’s heads have all the reality and correctness
of portraits. He gives the extremes of character and expression,
but he gives them with perfect truth and accuracy. This is in fact
what distinguishes his compositions from all others of the same kind,
that they are equally remote from caricature and from mere still-life.
It of course happens in subjects from common life, that the painter
can procure real models, and he can get them to sit as long as he
pleases. Hence, in general, those attitudes and expressions have been
chosen which could be assumed the longest; and in imitating which,
the artist, by taking pains and time, might produce almost as complete
a fac-simile as he could of a flower or a flower-pot, of a damask
curtain, or a china vase. The copy was as perfect and as uninteresting
in the one case as in the other. On the contrary, subjects of
drollery and ridicule affording frequent examples of strange deformity
and peculiarity of features, these have been eagerly seized by another
class of artists, who, without subjecting themselves to the laborious
drudgery of the Dutch school and their imitators, have produced our
popular caricatures, by rudely copying or exaggerating the casual
irregularities of the human countenance. Hogarth has equally avoided
the faults of both these styles—the insipid tameness of the one, and
the gross vulgarity of the other—so as to give to the productions of
his pencil equal solidity and effect: for his faces go to the very verge
of caricature, and yet never (we believe in any single instance) go
beyond it; they take the very widest latitude, and yet we always
see the links which bind them to nature: they bear all the marks,
and carry all the conviction of reality with them, as if we had seen
the actual faces for the first time, from the precision, consistency,
and good sense, with which the whole and every part is made out.
They exhibit the most uncommon features with the most uncommon
expressions, but which are yet as familiar and intelligible as possible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>because, with all the boldness, they have all the truth of nature.
Hogarth has left behind him as many of these memorable faces, in
their memorable moments, as, perhaps, most of us remember in the
course of our lives; and has thus doubled the quantity of our
observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have, in the present paper, attempted to point out the fund of
observation, physical and moral, contained in one set of these pictures,
the <cite>Marriage a-la-Mode</cite>. The rest would furnish as many topics to
descant upon, were the patience of the reader as inexhaustible as the
painter’s invention. But as this is not the case, we shall content
ourselves with barely referring to some of those figures in the other
pictures, which appear the most striking; and which we see, not
only while we are looking at them, but which we have before us
at all other times.—For instance: who, having seen, can easily
forget that exquisite frost-piece of religion and morality, the antiquated
prude, in the picture of <cite>Morning</cite>? or that striking commentary
on the <em>good old times</em>, the little wretched appendage of a foot-boy,
who crawls, half famished and half frozen, behind her? The
French man and woman, in the <cite>Noon</cite>, are the perfection of flighty
affectation and studied grimace; the amiable <em>fraternization</em> of the
two old women saluting each other, is not enough to be admired;
and in the little master, in the same national group, we see the early
promise and personification of that eternal principle of wondrous self-complacency,
proof against all circumstances, which makes the
French the only people who are vain, even of being cuckolded and
being conquered! Or shall we prefer to this, the outrageous distress
and unmitigated terrors of the boy who has dropped his dish of meat,
and who seems red all over with shame and vexation, and bursting
with the noise he makes? Or what can be better than the good
housewifery of the girl underneath, who is devouring the lucky
fragments? Or than the plump, ripe, florid, luscious look of the
servant-wench, embraced by a greasy rascal of an Othello, with her
pye-dish tottering like her virtue, and with the most precious part of
its contents running over? Just—no, not quite—as good, is the joke
of the woman over head, who, having quarrelled with her husband,
is throwing their Sunday’s dinner out of the window, to complete
this chapter of accidents of baked dishes. The husband, in the
<cite>Evening</cite> scene, is certainly as meek as any recorded in history; but
we cannot say that we admire this picture, or the <cite>Night</cite> scene after
it. But then in the <cite>Taste in High Life</cite>, there is that inimitable
pair, differing only in sex, congratulating and delighting one another
by ‘all the mutually reflected charities’ of folly and affectation; with
the young lady, coloured like a rose, dandling her little, black, pug-faced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>white-teethed, chuckling favourite; and with the portrait of
Mons. Des Noyers, in the background, dancing in a grand ballet,
surrounded by butterflies. And again, in <cite>The Election Dinner</cite>, is
the immortal cobbler, surrounded by his peers, who ‘frequent and
full,’—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In <em>loud</em> recess and <em>brawling</em> conclave sit:’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>the Jew, in the second picture, a very Jew in grain—innumerable fine
sketches of heads in the <cite>Polling for Votes</cite>, of which the nobleman,
overlooking the caricaturist, is the best;—and then the irresistible,
tumultuous display of broad humour in the <cite>Chairing the Member</cite>,
which is, perhaps, of all Hogarth’s pictures, the most full of laughable
incidents and situations. The yellow, rusty-faced thresher, with his
swinging flail, breaking the head of one of the chairmen; and his
redoubted antagonist, the sailor, with his oak stick, and stumping
wooden leg, a supplemental cudgel—the persevering ecstasy of the
hobbling blind fiddler, who, in the fray, appears to have been trod
upon by the artificial excrescence of the honest tar—Monsieur, the
Monkey, with piteous aspect, speculating the impending disaster of
the triumphant candidate; and his brother Bruin, appropriating the
paunch—the precipitous flight of the pigs, souse over head into the
water—the fine lady fainting, with vermilion lips—and the two
chimney sweepers, satirical young rogues! We had almost forgot
the politician, who is burning a hole through his hat with a candle,
in reading a newspaper; and the chickens, in <cite>The March to Finchley</cite>,
wandering in search of their lost dam, who is found in the pocket
of the serjeant. Of the pictures in <cite>The Rake’s Progress</cite> we shall
not here say any thing, because we think them, on the whole, inferior
to the prints; and because they have already been criticised by a
writer, to whom we could add nothing, in a paper which ought to be
read by every lover of Hogarth and of English genius.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c017'><em>Notes of a Journey through France and Italy, By W. Hazlitt</em>, was published in
1826, in an 8vo. volume (9 × 5¼ inches). Printed for Hunt and Clarke, Tavistock-Street,
Covent-Garden. The printer’s name is given behind the title-page as
‘William Clowes, Northumberland-court,’ and the following lines from <cite>Cymbeline</cite>
(Act <span class='fss'>III.</span> 4.) appear underneath the author’s name on the title-page:—</p>

<p class='c014'>As stated in the <span class='sc'>Advertisement</span>, the <cite>Notes</cite> were reprinted from the <cite>Morning

reprinted for the first time since the publication of the volume of 1826, and as
they appeared in that volume. A few passages which appeared in the papers as
they came out in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, and were omitted when Hazlitt collected
the letters in book-form, will be found among the notes at the end of the volume.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following <cite>Notes of a Journey through France and Italy</cite> are
reprinted from the columns of the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>. The favourable
reception they met with there suggested the idea of the present work.
My object has been to describe what I saw or remarked myself; or
to give the reader some notion of what he might expect to find in
travelling the same road. There is little of history or antiquities or
statistics; nor do I regret the want of them, as it may be abundantly
supplied from other sources. The only thing I could have wished
to expatiate upon more at large is the <em>manners</em> of the country: but
to do justice to this, a greater length of time and a more intimate
acquaintance with society and the language would be necessary.
Perhaps, at some future opportunity, this defect may be remedied.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class='c008'>The rule for travelling abroad is to take our common sense with us,
and leave our prejudices behind us. The object of travelling is to see
and learn; but such is our impatience of ignorance, or the jealousy of
our self-love, that we generally set up a certain preconception beforehand
(in self-defence, or as a barrier against the lessons of experience,)
and are surprised at or quarrel with all that does not conform to it.
Let us think what we please of what we really find, but prejudge
nothing. The English, in particular, carry out their own defects as
a standard for general imitation; and think the virtues of others (that
are not <em>their</em> vices) good for nothing. Thus they find fault with the
gaiety of the French as impertinence, with their politeness as grimace.
This repulsive system of carping and contradiction can extract neither
use nor meaning from any thing, and only tends to make those who
give way to it uncomfortable and ridiculous. On the contrary, we
should be as seldom shocked or annoyed as possible, (it is our vanity
or ignorance that is mortified much oftener than our reason!) and
contrive to see the favourable side of things. This will turn both to
profit and pleasure. The intellectual, like the physical, is best kept
up by an exchange of commodities, instead of an ill-natured and idle
search after grievances. The first thing an Englishman does on going
abroad is to find fault with what is French, because it is not English.
If he is determined to confine all excellence to his own country, he
had better stay at home.</p>

<p class='c000'>On arriving at Brighton (in the full season,) a lad offered to
conduct us to an inn. ‘Did he think there was room?’ He was
sure of it. ‘Did he belong to the inn?’ No, he was from London.
In fact, he was a young gentleman from town, who had been stopping
some time at the White-Horse Hotel, and who wished to employ his
spare time (when he was not riding out on a blood-horse) in serving
the house, and relieving the perplexities of his fellow-travellers. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>one but a Londoner would volunteer his assistance in this way.
Amiable land of <em>Cockayne</em>, happy in itself, and in making others
happy! Blest exuberance of self-satisfaction, that overflows upon
others! Delightful impertinence, that is forward to oblige them!</p>

<p class='c000'>There is something in being near the sea, like the confines of
eternity. It is a new element, a pure abstraction. The mind loves
to hover on that which is endless, and forever the same. People
wonder at a steam-boat, the invention of man, managed by man, that
makes its liquid path like an iron railway through the sea—I wonder
at the sea itself, that vast Leviathan, rolled round the earth, smiling
in its sleep, waked into fury, fathomless, boundless, a huge world of
water-drops—Whence is it, whither goes it, is it of eternity or of
nothing? Strange, ponderous riddle, that we can neither penetrate
nor grasp in our comprehension, ebbing and flowing like human life,
and swallowing it up in thy remorseless womb,—what art thou?
What is there in common between thy life and ours, who gaze at
thee? Blind, deaf and old, thou seest not, hearest not, understandest
not; neither do we understand, who behold and listen to thee!
Great as thou art, unconscious of thy greatness, unwieldy, enormous,
preposterous twin-birth of matter, rest in thy dark, unfathomed cave
of mystery, mocking human pride and weakness. Still is it given to
the mind of man to wonder at thee, to confess its ignorance, and to
stand in awe of thy stupendous might and majesty, and of its own
being, that can question thine! But a truce with reflections.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pavilion at Brighton is like a collection of stone pumpkins and
pepper-boxes. It seems as if the genius of architecture had at once
the dropsy and the <em>megrims</em>. Any thing more fantastical, with a
greater dearth of invention, was never seen. The King’s stud (if
they were horses of taste) would petition against so irrational a
lodging.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brighton stands facing the sea, on the bare cliffs, with glazed
windows to reflect the glaring sun, and black pitchy bricks shining
like the scales of fishes. The town is however gay with the influx
of London visitors—happy as the conscious abode of its sovereign!
Every thing here appears in motion—coming or going. People at a
watering-place may be compared to the flies of a summer; or to
fashionable dresses, or suits of clothes walking about the streets. The
only idea you gain is, of finery and motion. The road between
London and Brighton presents some very charming scenery; Reigate
is a prettier English country-town than is to be found anywhere—out
of England! As we entered Brighton in the evening, a Frenchman
was playing and singing to a guitar. It was a relief to the conversation
in the coach, which had been chiefly supported in a nasal tone by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>a disciple of Mrs. Fry and amanuensis of philanthropy in general.
As we heard the lively musician warble, we forgot the land of
Sunday-schools and spinning-jennies. The genius of the South had
come out to meet us.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left Brighton in the steam-packet, and soon saw the shores of
Albion recede from us. <em>Out of sight, out of mind.</em> How poor a
geographer is the human mind! How small a space does the
imagination take in at once! In travelling, our ideas change like the
scenes of a pantomime, displacing each other as completely and
rapidly. Long before we touched on French ground, the English
coast was lost in distance, and nothing remained of it but a dim mist;
it hardly seemed ‘in a great pool a swan’s nest.’ So shall its glory
vanish like a vapour, its liberty like a dream!</p>

<p class='c000'>We had a fine passage in the steam-boat (Sept. 1, 1824). Not
a cloud, scarce a breath of air; a moon, and then star-light, till the
dawn, with rosy fingers, ushered us into Dieppe. Our fellow-passengers
were pleasant and unobtrusive, an English party of the
better sort: a Member of Parliament, delighted to escape from ‘late
hours and bad company;’ an English General, proud of his bad
French; a Captain in the Navy, glad to enter a French harbour
peaceably; a Country Squire, extending his inquiries beyond his
paternal acres; the younger sons of wealthy citizens, refined through
the strainers of a University-education and finishing off with foreign
travel; a young Lawyer, quoting Peregrine Pickle, and divided
between his last circuit and projected tour. There was also a young
Dutchman, looking mild through his mustachios, and a new-married
couple (a French Jew and Jewess) who grew uxorious from the
effects of sea-sickness, and took refuge from the qualms of the
disorder in paroxysms of tenderness. We had some difficulty in
getting into the harbour, and had to wait till morning for the tide.
I grew very tired, and laid the blame on the time lost in getting some
restive horses on board, but found that if we had set out two hours
sooner, we should only have had to wait two hours longer. The
doctrine of <em>Optimism</em> is a very good and often a very true one in
travelling. In advancing up the steps to give the officers our
passport, I was prevented by a young man and woman, who said they
were before me, and on making a second attempt, an elderly
gentleman and lady set up the same claim, because they stood <em>behind</em>
me. It seemed that a servant was waiting with passports for four.
Persons in a certain class of life are so full of their own business and
importance, that they imagine every one else must be aware of it—I
hope this is the last specimen I shall for some time meet with of
city-manners. After a formal custom-house search, we procured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>admittance at Pratt’s Hotel, where they said they had reserved a bed
for a Lady. France is a country where they give <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">honneur aux Dames</span></i>.
The window looked out on the bridge and on the river, which
reflected the shipping and the houses; and we should have thought
ourselves luckily off, but that the bed, which occupied a niche in the
sitting-room, had that kind of odour which could not be mistaken for
otto of roses.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dieppe.</span>—This town presents a very agreeable and romantic
appearance to strangers. It is cut up into a number of distinct
divisions by canals, drawbridges, and bastions, as if to intercept the
progress of an enemy. The best houses, too, are shut up in close
courts and high walls on the same principle, that is, to stand a further
siege in the good old times. There are rows of lime-trees on the
quay, and some of the narrow streets running from it look like wells.
This town is a picture to look at; it is a pity that it is not a nosegay,
and that the passenger who ventures to explore its nooks and alleys
is driven back again by ‘a compound of villainous smells,’ which
seem to grow out of the ground. In walking the streets, one must
take one’s nose with one, and that sense is apt to be offended in
France as well as in Scotland. Is it hence called in French the
<em>organ of sense</em>? The houses and the dresses are equally old-fashioned.
In France one lives in the imagination of the past; in England every
thing is new and on an improved plan. Such is the progress of
mechanical invention! In Dieppe there is one huge, misshapen, but
venerable-looking Gothic Church (a theological fixture,) instead of
twenty new-fangled erections, Egyptian, Greek or Coptic. The
head-dresses of the women are much the same as those which the
<cite>Spectator</cite> laughed out of countenance a hundred years ago in England,
with high plaited crowns, and lappets hanging down over the
shoulders. The shape and colours of the bodice and petticoat are
what we see in Dutch pictures; the faces of the common people we
are familiarized with in Mieris and Jan Steen. They are full and
fair like the Germans, and have not the <em>minced</em> and peaked character
we attribute to the French. They are not handsome, but good-natured,
expressive, placid. They retain the look of peasants more
than the town’s-people with us, whether from living more in the open
air, or from greater health and temperance, I cannot say. What
I like in their expression (so far) is not the vivacity, but the goodness,
the simplicity, the thoughtful resignation. The French are
full of gesticulation when they speak; they have at other times an
equal appearance of repose and content. You see the figure of a girl
sitting in the sun, so still that her dress seems like streaks of red and
black chalk against the wall; a soldier reading; a group of old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>women (with skins as tough, yellow, and wrinkled as those of a
tortoise) chatting in a corner and laughing till their sides are ready to
split; or a string of children tugging a fishing-boat out of the harbour
as evening goes down, and making the air ring with their songs and
shouts of merriment (a sight to make Mr. Malthus shudder!). Life
here glows, or spins carelessly round on its soft axle. The same
animal spirits that supply a fund of cheerful thoughts, break out into
all the extravagance of mirth and social glee. The air is a cordial
to them, and they drink drams of sunshine. My particular liking to
the French is, however, confined to their natural and unsophisticated
character. The good spirits ‘with which they are clothed and fed,’
and which eke out the deficiencies of fortune or good government,
are perhaps too much for them, when joined with external advantages,
or artificial pretensions. Their vivacity becomes insolence in office;
their success, presumption; their gentility, affectation and grimace.
But the national physiognomy (taken at large) is the reflection of
good temper and humanity. One thing is evident, and decisive in
their favour—they do not insult or point at strangers, but smile on
them good-humouredly, and answer them civilly.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleas’d with thyself, whom all the world can please!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Nothing shews the contented soul within, so much as our not
seeking for amusement in the mortifications of others: we only envy
their advantages, or sneer at their defects, when we are conscious of
wanting something ourselves. The customs and employments of the
people here have a more primitive and picturesque appearance than in
England. Is it that with us every thing is made domestic and
commodious, instead of being practised in the open air, and subject
to the casualties of the elements? For instance, you see the women
washing clothes in the river, with their red petticoats and bare feet,
instead of standing over a washing-tub. Human life with us is
framed and set in comforts: but it wants the vivid colouring, the
glowing expression that we meet elsewhere. After all, is not the
romantic effect produced partly owing to the novelty of the scene;
or do we not attribute to a superiority in others what is merely a
greater liveliness of impression in ourselves, arising from curiosity
and contrast? If this were all, foreigners ought to be as much
delighted with us, but they are not. A man and woman came and
sung ‘God save the King,’ before the windows of the Hotel, as if
the French had so much loyalty at present that they can spare us
some of it. What an opinion must they have formed of the absurd
nationality of the English, to suppose that we can expect them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>feel this sort of mock-sentiment towards our King! What English
ballad-singer would dream of flattering the French visitors by a song
in praise of Louis <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Desiré</span></i> before a Brighton or a Dover Hotel?</p>

<p class='c000'>As the door opened just now, I saw the lad or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i>, who waits
on us, going up stairs with a looking-glass, and admiring himself in it.
If he is pleased with himself, he is no less satisfied with us, and with
every thing else.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class='c008'>The road from Dieppe to Rouen is highly interesting. You at first
ascend a straight steep hill, which commands a view of the town and
harbour behind you, with villas on each side, something between
modern cottages and antique castles; and afterwards, from the top of
the hill, the prospect spreads out over endless plains, richly cultivated.
It has been conjectured that the English borrowed their implements
and modes of husbandry from their Norman Conquerors; the resemblance
is, indeed, complete to a deception. You might suppose one
side of the channel was transported to the other, from the general
aspect of the country, from the neatness of the orchard-plots, the
gardens, and farm-yards. Every thing has a look of the greatest
industry and plenty. There is a scanty proportion of common
pasturage; but rich fields of clover, oats, barley, and vetches, with
luxuriant crops ready to cut, are presented to the eye in uninterrupted
succession; there are no wastes, no barren, thankless enclosures;
every foot of ground seems to be cultivated with the utmost success.
It is in vain after this to talk of English agriculture, as if no such
thing existed anywhere else. Agriculture can do no more than
make provision that every part of the soil is carefully tilled, and raise
the finest crops from it. The only distinctive feature is, that there
are here no hedges along the road-side, their place being supplied by
rows of apple-trees or groves of elm and poplar, which stretch out
before you in lengthened vistas, as far as the eye can reach. We
like this, whatever Mr. Mac-Adam may object; and moreover, the
roads here are as good as his. To be sure, they are much broader,
and admit of this collateral improvement. Shady plantations open
their arms to meet you, closing in a point, or terminated by a turn in
the road; and then you enter upon another long hospitable avenue,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Bidding the lovely scenes at distance hail;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>the smiling landscape waves on either side to a considerable extent;
you pass a shepherd tending his flock, or a number of peasants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>returning from market in a light long waggon, like a hen-coop; the
bells of the horses jingle, the postilion cracks his whip, or speaks to
them with a friendly voice, and the <em>Diligence</em> rolls on, at the rate of
six miles an hour towards Paris!—Travelling is much cheaper in
France than in England. The distance from Dieppe to Rouen is
thirty-six miles, and we only paid eight francs, that is, six shillings
and eight pence a-piece, with two francs more to the guide and
postilion, which is not fourpence a mile, including all expenses. On
the other hand, you have not the advantage of taking an outside
place at half-price, as a very trifling difference is made in this
respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Diligence itself cuts a very awkward figure, compared with
our stage-coaches. There is much the same difference as between
a barge and a pleasure-boat; but then it is roomy and airy, and
remarkably easy in its motion. In the common mechanic arts the
French attend to the essential only; we are so fond of elegance and
compactness, that we sacrifice ease to show and finish. The harness
of the horses is made of ropes or rusty leather, and it is wonderful
how they get along so well as they do, three, or sometimes four
a-breast. The apples of the orchards hang over the road-side, which
speaks well for the honesty of the inhabitants, or the plenty of the
country. The women appear to work a good deal out of doors.
Some of the older ones have strangely distorted visages, and those
horrid Albert-Durer chins and noses, that have been coming together
for half a century. The younger ones are handsome, healthy-looking,
animated; a better sort of English country girls. The
character of French coquetry prevails even here, and you see a
young peasant-girl, broiling in the sun, with a blue paper cap on her
head, that glitters like the smoothest satin, and that answers the
purpose of finery just as well. I observed that one man frequently
holds the plough and guides the horses without any one else to assist
him, as they do in Scotland, and which in England they hold to be
an agricultural heresy. In Surrey, where an English gentleman had
hired a Scotch servant to try this method, the boors actually collected
round the man in the church-yard on Sunday, and pointed at him,
crying, ‘That’s he who ploughs and drives the horses himself!’
Our prejudices are no less on the alert, and quite as obstinate against
what is right as what is wrong. I cannot say I was quite pleased
with my barber at Dieppe, who inserted a drop of citron juice in the
lather I was to shave with, and converted it into a most agreeable
perfume. It was an association of ideas, a false refinement, to which
I had not been accustomed, and to which I was averse. The best
excuse I could find for my reluctance to be pleased, was that at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>next place where the same thing was attempted, the operator, by
some villainous mixture, almost stunk me to death!</p>

<p class='c000'>The entrance into Rouen, through extensive archways of tall
trees, planted along the margin of the Seine, is certainly delectable.
Here the genius of civilized France first began to display itself.
Companies of men and women were sitting in the open air, enjoying
the cool of the evening, and the serene moonlight, under Chinese
lamps, with fruit and confectionery. We arrived rather late, but
were well received and accommodated at the Hotel Vatel. My bad
French by no means, however, conciliates the regard or increases the
civility of the people on the road. They pay particular attention,
and are particularly delighted with the English, who speak French
well, or with tolerable fluency and correctness, for they think it a
compliment to themselves and to the language; whereas, besides
their dislike to all difficulty and uncertainty of communication, they
resent an obvious neglect on this point as an affront, and an unwarrantable
assumption of superiority, as if it were enough for an Englishman
to shew himself among them to be well received, without so much as
deigning to make himself intelligible. A person, who passes through
a country in sullen silence, must appear very much in the character of
a spy. Many things (a native is conscious) will seem strange to a
foreigner, who can neither ask the meaning, nor understand the
explanation of them; and on the other hand, if in these circumstances
you are loquacious and inquisitive, you become proportionably troublesome.
It would have been better (such is the natural feeling, the
dictate at once of self-love and common sense) to have learned the
language before you visited the country. An accent, an occasional
blunder, a certain degree of hesitation are amusing, and indirectly
flatter the pride of foreigners; but a total ignorance or wilful
reluctance in speaking shews both a contempt for the people, and an
inattention to good manners. To neglect to make one’s self master
of a language tacitly implies, that in travelling through a country we
have neither wants nor wishes to gratify; that we are quite independent,
and have no ambition to give pleasure, or to receive
instruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Rouen the walls of our apartment were bare, being mere lath
and plaster, a huge cobweb hung in the window, the curtains were
shabby and dirty, and the floor without carpeting or matting; but
our table was well-furnished, and in the English taste. French
cooking comprehends English, and easily condescends to it; so that
an Englishman finds himself better off in France than a Frenchman
does in England. They complain that our cookery is dry, and our
solid, unsavoury morsels, beef-steaks, and mutton chops, must stick in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>their throats as well as be repulsive to their imaginations; nor can
we supply the additional sauces or disguises which are necessary to
set them off. On the other hand, we had a dinner at the Hotel
Vatel, a roast fowl, greens, and bacon, as plain, as sweet, and wholesome,
as we could get at an English farm-house. We had also
pigeons, partridges, and other game, in excellent preservation, and
kept quite clear of French receipts and odious ragouts. Game or
poultry is the half-way house, a sort of middle point, between French
and English cookery. The bread here is excellent, the butter
admirable, the milk and coffee superior to what we meet with at
home. The wine and fruit, too, are delightful, but real French
dishes are an abomination to an English palate. Unless a man
means to stay all his life abroad, let him beware of making the
experiment, or get near enough to the door to make his <em>exit</em> suddenly.
The common charges at the inns are much the same as in England;
we paid twenty-pence for breakfast, and half a crown, or three
shillings, for dinner. The best Burgundy is only three shillings and
fourpence a bottle. A green parrot hung in a cage, in a small court
under our window, and received the compliments and caresses of
every one who passed. It is wonderful how fond the French are of
holding conversation with animals of all descriptions, parrots, dogs,
monkeys. Is it that they choose to have all the talk to themselves,
to make propositions, and fancy the answers; that they like this
discourse by signs, by <em>jabbering</em>, and gesticulation, or that the manifestation
of the principle of life without thought delights them above
all things? The sociableness of the French seems to expand itself
beyond the level of humanity, and to be unconscious of any descent.
Two boys in the kitchen appeared to have nothing to do but to beat
up the white of eggs into froth for salads. The labour of the French
costs them nothing, so that they readily throw it away in doing
nothing or the merest trifles. A nice-looking girl who officiated as
chamber-maid, brought in a ripe melon after dinner, and offering it
with much grace and good humour as ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un petit cadeau</span>’ (a trifling
present) was rather hurt we did not accept of it. Indeed it was
wrong. A Mr. James Williams acted as our English interpreter
while we staid, and procured us places in the Paris Diligence, though
it was said to be quite full. We here also heard that the packet
we came over in, blew up two days after, and that the passengers
escaped in fishing-boats. This has completed my distaste to steam-boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>The city of Rouen is one of the oldest and finest in France. It
contains about a hundred thousand inhabitants, two noble churches;
a handsome quay is embosomed in a range of lofty hills, and watered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>by the Seine, which, proud of its willowy banks and tufted islands,
winds along by it. The ascent up the rising grounds behind it, is
magnificent beyond description. The town is spread out at your
feet (an immense, stately mass of dark grey stone), the double towers
of the old Gothic Cathedral, and of the beautiful Church of St.
Antoine, rise above it in their majestic proportions, overlooking the
rich sunny valleys which stretch away in the distance; you gradually
climb an amphitheatre of hills, sprinkled with gardens and villas to
the very top, and the walk on Sunday afternoon is crowded with
people enjoying the scene, adding to its animation by their intelligent,
varying looks, and adorning it by their picturesque and richly-coloured
dresses. There is no town in England at the same time so
fine, and so finely situated. Oxford is as fine in its buildings and
associations, but it has not the same advantages of situation: Bristol
is as fine a mass of buildings, but without the same striking accompaniments—</p>

<p class='c000'>Edinburgh alone is as splendid in its situation and buildings, and
would have even a more imposing and delightful effect if Arthur’s
Seat were crowned with thick woods, if the Pentland-hills could be
converted into green pastures, if the Scotch people were French, and
Leith-walk planted with vineyards! The only blot in this fair scene
was the meeting with a number of cripples, whose hideous cries
attracted and alarmed attention before their formidable mutilations
became visible, and who extorted charity rather from terror than
pity. Such objects abound in France and on the Continent. Is it
from the want of hospitals, or from the bad care taken of the young
and necessitous, to whom some dreadful accident has happened?—The
hill that commands this beautiful prospect, and seems the resort
of health, of life, of pleasure, is called (as I found on inquiry) <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mont
des Malades</span></i>! Would any people but the French think of giving it
so inauspicious a title? To the English such a name would spoil
the view, and infect the imagination with the recollections of pain
and sickness. But a Frenchman’s imagination is proof against such
weaknesses; he has no sympathy except with the pleasurable; and
provided a hill presents an agreeable prospect, never troubles his
head whether the inhabitants are sick or well. The streets of
Rouen, like those of other towns in France, are dirty for the
same reason. A Frenchman’s senses and understanding are alike
inaccessible to pain—he recognises (happily for himself) the
existence only of that which adds to his importance or his
satisfaction. He is delighted with perfumes, but passes over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>most offensive smells,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and will not lift up his little finger to remove
a general nuisance, for it is none to him. He leaves the walls of his
houses unfinished, dilapidated, almost uninhabitable, because his
thoughts are bent on adorning his own person—on jewels, trinkets,
<em>pomade divine</em>! He is elaborate in his cookery and his dress, because
the one flatters his vanity, the other his appetite; and he is licentious
in his pleasures, nay gross in his manners, because in the first he
consults only his immediate gratification, and in the last annoys others
continually, from having no conception that any thing he (a Frenchman)
can do can possibly annoy them. He is sure to offend, because
he takes it for granted he must please. A great deal of ordinary
French conversation might be spared before foreigners, if they knew
the pain it gives. Virtue is not only put out of countenance by it,
but vice becomes an indifferent <em>common-place</em> in their mouths. The
last stage of human depravity is, when vice ceases to shock—or to
please. A Frenchman’s candour and indifference to what must be
thought of him (combined with his inordinate desire to shine) are
curious. The hero of his own little tale carries a load of crimes and
misfortunes at his back like a lead of band-boxes, and (light-hearted
wretch) sings and dances as he goes! The inconsequentiality in the
French character, from extreme facility and buoyancy of impression,
is a matter of astonishment to the English. A young man at Rouen
was walking briskly along the street to church, all the way tossing
his prayer-book into the air, when suddenly on reaching the entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>a priest appeared coming from church, and he fell on his knees on
the steps. No wonder the Popish clergy stand up for their religion,
when it makes others fall on their knees before them, and worship
their appearance as the shadow of the Almighty! The clergy in
France present an agreeable and almost necessary foil to the foibles
of the national character, with their sombre dress, their gravity, their
simplicity, their sanctity. It is not strange they exert such an
influence there: their professional pretensions to learning and piety
must have a double weight, from having nothing to oppose to them
but frivolity and the impulse of the moment. The entering the
Cathedral here after the bustle and confusion of the streets, is like
entering a vault—a tomb of worldly thoughts and pleasures, pointing
to the skies. The slow and solemn movements of the Priests, as
grave as they are unmeaning, resemble the spells of necromancers;
the pictures and statues of the dead contrast strangely with the faces
of the living; the chaunt of the Priests sounds differently from the
jargon of the common people; the little oratories and cells, with some
lone mourner kneeling before a crucifix, every thing leads the thoughts
to another world, to death, the resurrection, and a judgment to come.
The walls and ornaments of this noble pile are left in a state of the
most lamentable neglect, and the infinite number of paltry, rush-bottomed
chairs, huddled together in the aisle, are just like the
rubbish of a broker’s shop. The great bell of the Cathedral is
the most deep-mouthed I ever heard, ‘swinging slow with sullen
roar,’ rich and sonorous, and hoarse with counting the flight of a
thousand years. It is worth while to visit France, were it only
to see Rouen.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>The Road to Paris.</span>—They vaunt much of the <em>Lower Road</em> from
Rouen to Paris; but it is not so fine as that from Dieppe to Rouen.
You have comparatively few trees, the soil is less fertile, and you are
(nearly the whole way) tantalized with the vast, marshy-looking
plains of Normandy, with the Seine glittering through them like a
snake, and a chain of abrupt chalky hills, like a wall or barrier
bounding them. There is nothing I hate like a distant prospect
without any thing interesting in it—it is continually dragging the eye
a wearisome journey, and repaying it with barrenness and deformity.
Yet a Frenchman contrived to make a panegyric on this scene, after
the fashion of his countrymen, and with that sort of tripping jerk
which is peculiar to their minds and bodies—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il y a de l’eau, il y a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>des bois, il y a des montagnes, il y a de la verdure</span></i>,’ &amp;c. It is true,
there were all these things in the abstract, or as so many detached
particulars to make a speech about, which was all that he wanted.
A Frenchman’s eye for nature is merely <em>nominal</em>. I find that with
the novelty, or on farther experience my enthusiasm for the country
and the people, palls a little. During a long day’s march (for I was
too late, or rather too ill to go by the six o’clock morning Diligence,)
I got as tired of toiling on under a scorching sun and over a dusty
road, as if I had been in England. Indeed, I could almost have
fancied myself there, for I scarcely met with a human being to
remind me of the difference. I at one time encountered a horseman
mounted on a <em>demipique</em> saddle, in a half military uniform, who seemed
determined to make me turn out of the foot-path,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a> or to ride over me.
This looked a little English, though the man did not. I should take
him for an Exciseman. I suppose in all countries people on horseback
give themselves airs of superiority over those who are on foot.
The French character is not altogether compounded of the amiable,
any more than the English is of the respectable. In judging of
nations, it will not do to deal in mere abstractions. In countries, as
well as individuals, there is a mixture of good and bad qualities; yet
we may attempt to strike a general balance, and compare the rules
with the exceptions. Soon after my equestrian adventure (or escape,)
I met with another pleasanter one; a little girl, with regular features
and dark eyes, dressed in white, and with a large straw bonnet
flapping over her face, was mounted behind a youth who seemed to
be a relation, on an ass—a common mode of conveyance in this
country. The young lad was trying to frighten her, by forcing the
animal out of its usual easy pace into a canter, while she, holding
fast, and between laughing and crying, called out in a voice of great
sweetness and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>naïveté</em>—‘<em>Il n’est pas bon trotter, il n’est pas bon trotter</em>.’</span>
There was a playfulness in the expression of her terrors quite charming,
and quite French. They turned down an avenue to a villa a
little way out of the road. I could not help looking after them, and
thinking what a delightful welcome must await such innocence, such
cheerfulness, and such dark sparkling eyes! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais allons.</span></i> These
reflections are perhaps misplaced: France is not at present altogether
the land of gallantry or sentiment, were one ever so much disposed
to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within half a mile of Louviers (which is seven leagues from
Rouen) a Diligence passed me on the road at the full speed of a
French Diligence, rolling and rumbling on its way over a paved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>road, with five clumsy-looking horses, and loaded to the top like a
Plymouth van. I was to stop at Louviers, at the Hotel de Mouton,
and to proceed to Paris by the coach the next day; for I was told
there was no conveyance onwards that day, and I own that this
apparition of a Diligence in full sail, and in broad day (when I had
understood there were none but night coaches) surprised me. I was
going to set it down in ‘my tables,’ that there is no faith to be placed
in what they say at French inns. I quickened my pace in hopes of
overtaking it while it changed horses. The main street of Louviers
appeared to me very long and uneven. On turning a corner, the
Hotel de Mouton opened its gates to receive me, the Diligence
was a little farther on, with fresh horses just put to and ready to start
(a critical and provoking dilemma;) I hesitated a moment, and at
last resolved to take my chance in the Diligence, and seeing Paris
written on the outside, and being informed by <em>Monsieur le Conducteur</em>,
that I could stop at Evreux for the night, I took the rest for granted,
and mounted in the cabriolet, where sat an English gentleman (one
of those with whom I had come over in the steam-boat,) solitary and
silent. My seating myself in the opposite corner of the cabriolet
(which is that part of a French Diligence which is placed in front,
and resembles a post-chaise in form and ease,) did not break the
solitude or the silence. In company, <em>two negatives do not make an
affirmative</em>. I know few things more delightful than for two Englishmen
to loll in a post-chaise in this manner, taking no notice of each
other, preserving an obstinate silence, and determined to send their
country <em>to Coventry</em>.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a> We pretended not to recognise each other, and
yet our saying nothing proved every instant that we were not French.
At length, about half way, my companion opened his lips, and asked
in thick, broken French, ‘How far it was to Evreux?’ I looked at
him, and said in English, ‘I did not know.’ Not another word
passed, yet, I dare say, both of us had a very agreeable time of it,
as the Diligence moved on to Evreux, making reflections on the
national character, and each thinking himself an exception to its
absurdities, an instance of its virtues; so easy is it always (and more
particularly abroad) to fancy ourselves free from the errors we witness
in our neighbours. It is this, indeed, which makes us so eager to
detect them, as if to see what is wrong was the same thing as being
in the right!</p>

<p class='c000'>At Evreux, I found I had gone quite out of my road, and that
there was no conveyance to Paris till the same hour the next night.
I was a good deal mortified and perplexed at this intelligence, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>found some consolation at the Office where I obtained it, from
casually hearing the name of my companion, which is a great point
gained in travelling. Of course, the discovery is pleasant, if it is a
name you are acquainted with; or if not, at least you have the satisfaction
of knowing it is some one you do <em>not</em> know, and so are made
easy on that head. I bespoke a bed, and was shown into the common
room, where I took coffee, and had what the Scotch call a <em>brandered
fowl</em> for supper. The room was papered with marine landscapes, so
that you seemed sitting in the open air with boats and trees and the
sea-shore all round you, and Telemachus and Calypso, figures landing
or embarking on halcyon seas. Even a country-inn in France is
classical. It is a pity that the English are so dull and sluggish, ‘like
the fat weed that roots itself at ease on Lethe’s wharf,’ that they
cannot lend themselves to these airy fictions, always staring them in
the face, but rather turn away from them with an impatience and
disgust proportioned to the elegance of the design and the tax levied
on their taste. A Frenchman’s imagination, on the contrary, is
always at the call of his senses. The latter have but to give the hint,
and the former is glad to take it! I tired every one out by inquiring
my best mode of getting on to Paris next day; and being slow to
believe that my only way was to go back to Louviers, like a fool as I
had come, a young Frenchman took compassion on my embarrassment,
and offered to be my interpreter, ‘as he spoke both languages.’ He
said, ‘I must feel great pain in not being able to express myself.’
I said ‘None but in giving others the trouble to understand me.’ He
shook his head, I spoke much too fast for him; he apologized for not
being able to follow me from want of habit, though he said, ‘he
belonged to a society of twelve at Paris, where they spoke English
every evening generally.’ I said, ‘we were well matched,’ and when
this was explained to him, he repeated the word ‘<em>matched</em>,’ with a
ludicrous air of distress, at finding that there was an English phrase
which was not familiarised to him in ‘the society of twelve, where
they spoke the English language generally every evening.’ We soon
came to a dead stand, and he turned to my English companion in the
cabriolet, on whom he bestowed, for the rest of the evening, the
tediousness of any ‘society of twelve.’ I could not help laughing to
see my luckless fellow-countryman, after one or two attempts to rally
and exchange remarks, reduced to the incessant repetition of his
melancholy ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">oui</span></i>,’ and my lively Parisian rioting in the advantage he
had obtained over a straggling Englishman, gliding from topic to topic
without contradiction or control, passing from the population of Paris
to the <em>Beaux-Arts</em>, from the Belles-Lettres to politics, running the
circle of knowledge, and finding himself still at home, faltering at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>mention of the Allies and the Bourbons, and rising with outstretched
arm and continuous voice at the name of <em>Buonopar-r</em> (like the eagle
soaring on level wing)—getting nearer and nearer the victim of his
volubility, seizing my poor friend by the button, and at last retiring
abruptly, as if afraid of a re-action, and wishing him ‘good repose’
for the evening. Happy member of a ‘society of twelve!’ Apt
representative of thirty millions of people, who build their self-esteem
on the basis of vanity, and weave happiness out of breath, which costs
them nothing! Why envy, why wish to interrupt them, like a mischievous
school-boy, who throws a great stone into a pond full of
frogs, who croak their delights ‘generally every evening,’ and who,
the instant the chasm is closed, return to the charge with unabated
glee and joyous dissonance!</p>

<p class='c000'>I must not forget to mention a favourable trait in the common
French character. I asked to speak to the <em>Conducteur</em>, and something
like a charge of deception was brought, from which he defended
himself strenuously. The whole kitchen and stable-yard gathered
round to hear a dispute, which was by no means waged with equal
war of words. They understood that I was disappointed, and had
made a ridiculous mistake. Not a word or look of derision was
observable in the whole group; but rather a rising smile, suppressed
for fear of giving pain, and a wish to suggest some expedient on the
occasion. In England, I will venture to say, that a Frenchman, in
similar circumstances, stammering out a grave charge of imposition
against a coachman, and evidently at a loss how to proceed, would
have been hooted out of the place, and it would have been well for
him if he had escaped without broken bones. If the French have
the vices of artificial refinement and effeminacy, the English still
retain too many of those which belong to a barbarous and savage
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>I returned to Louviers the next morning under the safe conduct of
my former guide, where I arrived half an hour before the necessary
time, found myself regularly booked for Paris, with five francs paid
on account; and after a very comfortable breakfast, where I was
waited on by a pretty, modest-looking <em>brunette</em> (for the French
country-girls are in general modest-looking,) I took my seat in the
<em>fourth place</em> of the Diligence. Here I met with every thing to annoy
an Englishman. There was a Frenchman in the coach, who had a
dog and a little boy with him, the last having a doll in his hands,
which he insisted on playing with; or cried and screamed furiously
if it was taken from him. It was a true French child; that is, a
little old man, like Leonardo da Vinci’s <cite>Laughing Boy</cite>, with eyes
glittering like the glass ones of his favourite doll, with flaxen ringlets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>like hers, with cheeks as smooth and unhealthy, and a premature
expression of cunning and self-complacency. A disagreeable or ill-behaved
child in a stage coach is a common accident, and to be
endured. But who but a Frenchman would think of carrying his
dog? He might as well drag his horse into the coach after him. A
Frenchman (with leave be it spoken) has no need to take a dog with
him to ventilate the air of a coach, in which there are three other
Frenchmen. It was impossible to suffer more from heat, from
pressure, or from the periodical ‘exhalation of rich-distilled perfumes.’
If the French have lost the sense of smell, they should reflect (as
they are a reflecting people) that others have not. Really, I do not
see how they have a right in a public vehicle to assault one in this
way by proxy, any more than to take one literally by the nose. One
does not expect from the most refined and polished people in Europe
grossnesses that an Esquimaux Indian would have too much sense
and modesty to be guilty of. If the presence of their dogs is a
nuisance, the conversation of their masters is often no less offensive to
another sense—both are suffocating to every body but themselves,
and worthy of each other. Midas whispered his secret to the reeds,
that whispered it again. The French, if they are wise, ought not to
commit the national character on certain delicate points in the manner
they do. While they were triumphant, less caution might be
necessary: but no people can afford at the same time to be odious
as well as contemptible in the eyes of their enemies. We dined at
Mantes, where the ordinary was plentiful and excellent, and where a
gentleman of a very prepossessing appearance took up the conversation
(descanting on the adventures of a shooting-party the day before) in
that gay, graceful, and animated tone, which I conceive to be
characteristic of the best French society. In talking and laughing,
he discovered (though a young man) the inroads which hot soups
and high-seasoned ragouts had made in his mouth, with the same
alacrity and good-humour as if he had to shew a complete set of the
whitest teeth. We passed an interesting village, situated on the slope
of a hill, with a quaint old tower projecting above it, and over-hanging
the Seine. Not far from the high road stands Rosny, once the seat
of the celebrated Sully. The approach to the capital on the side of
St. Germain’s is one continued succession of imposing beauty and
artificial splendour, of groves, of avenues, of bridges, of palaces,
and of towns like palaces, all the way to Paris, where the sight of
the Thuilleries completes the triumph of external magnificence, and
oppresses the soul with recollections not to be borne or to be
expressed!—Of them, perhaps, hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the coach coming along, a Frenchman was curious to learn of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Scotch gentleman, who spoke very respectable French, whether Lord
Byron was much regretted in England? He said there was much
beauty in his writings, but too much straining after effect. He
added, that there was no attempt at effect in Racine. This with
the French is a final appeal in matters of poetry and taste. A
translation of Lord Byron’s Works complete is common in all the
shops here. I am not sure whether an English Poet ought to be
proud of this circumstance or not. I also saw an <cite>Elegy on his Death</cite>
advertised, said to be written by his friend, Sir Thomas More.
How oddly the French combine things! There is a Sir Thomas
More in English History and Letters; but <em>that</em> Sir Thomas More
is not <em>this</em> Mr. Thomas Moore—‘let their discreet hearts believe it!’</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class='c008'>The first thing I did when I got to Paris was to go to the Louvre.
It was indeed ‘first and last and midst’ in my thoughts. Well
might it be so, for it had never been absent from them for twenty
years. I had gazed myself almost blind in looking at the precious
works of art it then contained—should I not weep myself blind in
looking at them again, after a lapse of half a life—or on finding them
gone, and with them gone all that I had once believed and hoped of
human kind? What could ever fill up that blank in my heart, fearful
to think upon—fearful to look upon? I was no longer young; and
he who had collected them, and ‘worn them as a rich jewel in his
Iron Crown,’ was dead, a captive and vanquished; and with him all
we who remained were ‘thrown into the pit,’ the lifeless bodies of
men, and wore round our necks the collar of servitude, and on our
foreheads the brand, and in our flesh and in our souls the stain of
thraldom and of the born slaves of Kings. Yet thus far had I come
once more ‘to dream and be an Emperour!’ Thou sacred shrine of
God-like magnificence, must not my heart fail and my feet stumble,
as I approach thee? How gladly would I kneel down and kiss thy
threshold; and crawl into thy presence, like an Eastern slave! For
here still linger the broken remains and the faded splendour of that
proud monument of the triumphs of art and of the majesty of man’s
nature over the mock-majesty of thrones! Here Genius and Fame
dwell together; ‘<em>School</em> calleth unto <em>School</em>,’ and mighty names
answer to each other; that old gallery points to the long, dim perspective
of waning years, and the shadow of Glory and of Liberty is
seen afar off. In pacing its echoing floors, I hear the sound of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>footsteps of my youth, and the dead start from their slumbers!...
In all the time that I had been away from thee, and amidst all the
changes that had happened in it, did I ever forget, did I ever profane
thee? Never for a moment or in thought have I swerved from thee,
or from the cause of which thou wert the pledge and crown. Often
have I sought thee in sleep, and cried myself awake to find thee, with
the heart-felt yearnings of intolerable affection. Still didst thou haunt
me, like a passionate dream—like some proud beauty, the queen and
mistress of my thoughts. Neither pain nor sickness could wean me
from thee—</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c000'>In the tangled forest or the barren waste—in the lowly hovel or the
lofty palace, thy roofs reared their vaulted canopy over my head, a
loftier palace, an ampler space—a ‘brave o’er-hanging firmament,’
studded with constellations of art. Wherever I was, thou wert with
me, above me and about me; and didst ‘hang upon the beatings of
my heart,’ a vision and a joy unutterable. There was one chamber
of the brain (at least) which I had only to unlock and be master of
boundless wealth—a treasure-house of pure thoughts and cherished
recollections. Tyranny could not master, barbarism slunk from it;
vice could not pollute, folly could not gainsay it. I had but to touch
a certain spring, and lo! on the walls the divine grace of Guido
appeared free from blemish—there were the golden hues of Titian,
and Raphael’s speaking faces, the splendour of Rubens, the gorgeous
gloom of Rembrandt, the airy elegance of Vandyke, and Claude’s
classic scenes lapped the senses in Elysium, and Poussin breathed the
spirit of antiquity over them. There, in that fine old lumber-room
of the imagination, were the Transfiguration, and the St. Peter
Martyr, with its majestic figures and its unrivalled landscape background.
There also were the two St. Jeromes, Domenichino’s and
Correggio’s—there ‘stood the statue that enchants the world’—there
were the Apollo and the Antinous, the Laocoon, the Dying
Gladiator, Diana and her Fawn, and all the glories of the antique
world—</p>

<p class='c000'>But Legitimacy did not ‘sit squat, like a toad,’ in one corner of it,
poisoning the very air, and keeping the free-born spirit aloof from it!</p>

<p class='c000'>There were one or two pictures (old favourites) that I wished to
see again, and that I was told still remained. I longed to know
whether they were there, and whether they would look the same.
It was fortunate I arrived when I did; for a week later the doors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>would have been shut against me, on occasion of the death of the
King. His bust is over the door, which I had nearly mistaken for
a head of Memnon—or some Egyptian God. After passing through
the modern French Exhibition (where I saw a picture by Sir
Thomas Lawrence, and a vile farrago of <em>Bourbon-Restoration</em> pictures,)
I came within sight of the Grand Gallery of the Louvre,
which is at present only railed off. One or two English stragglers
alone were in it. The coolness and stillness were contrasted with
the bustle, the heat, and the smell of the common apartments. My
thoughts rushed in and filled the empty space. Instead of the old
Republican door-keepers, with their rough voices and affectation of
equality, a servant in a court-livery stood at the gate. On presenting
myself, I inquired if a Monsieur Livernois (who had formerly ushered
me into this region of enchantment) were still there; but he was
gone or dead. My hesitation and foreign accent, with certain other
appeals, procured me admittance. I passed on without further
question. I cast a glance forward, and found that the Poussins were
there. At the sight of the first, which I distinctly recollected (a
fine green landscape, with stately ruins,) the tears came into my eyes,
and I passed an hour or two in that state of luxurious enjoyment,
which is the highest privilege of the mind of man, and which perhaps
makes him amends for many sorrows. To my surprise, instead of
finding the whole changed, I found every thing nearly in its place, as
I proceeded through the first compartments, which I did slowly, and
reserving the Italian pictures for a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon bouche</span></i>. The colours even
seemed to have been mellowed, and to have grown to the walls in
the last twenty years, as if the pictures had been fixed there by the
cramping-irons of Victory, instead of hanging loose and fluttering,
like so much tattered canvass, at the sound of English drums, and
breath of Prussian manifestoes. Nothing could be better managed
than the way in which they had blended the Claudes and Poussins
alternately together—the ethereal refinement and dazzling brilliancy
of the one relieving and giving additional zest to the sombre, grave,
massive character of the other. Claude Lorraine pours the spirit of
air over all objects, and new-creates them of light and sunshine. In
several of his master-pieces which are shewn here, the vessels, the
trees, the temples and middle distances glimmer between air and solid
substance, and seem moulded of a new element in nature. No words
can do justice to their softness, their precision, their sparkling effect.
But they do not lead the mind out of their own magic circle. They
repose on their own beauty; they fascinate with faultless elegance.
Poussin’s landscapes are more properly pictures of time than of place.
They have a fine <em>moral</em> perspective, not inferior to Claude’s aërial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>one. They carry the imagination back two or four thousand years
at least, and bury it in the remote twilight of history. There is an
opaqueness and solemnity in his colouring, assimilating with the tone
of long-past events: his buildings are stiff with age; his implements
of husbandry are such as would belong to the first rude stages of
civilization; his harvests are such (as in the Ruth and Boaz) as
would yield to no modern sickle; his grapes (as in the Return from
the Promised Land) are a load to modern shoulders; there is a
simplicity and undistinguishing breadth in his figures; and over all,
the hand of time has drawn its veil. Poussin has his faults; but, like
all truly great men, there is that in him which is to be found nowhere
else; and even the excellences of others would be defects in him.
One picture of his in particular drew my attention, which I had not
seen before. It is an addition to the Louvre, and makes up for
many a flaw in it. It is the Adam and Eve in Paradise, and it is all
that Mr. Martin’s picture of that subject is not. It is a scene of
sweetness and seclusion ‘to cure all sadness but despair.’ There is
the freshness of the first dawn of creation, immortal verdure, the
luxuriant budding growth of unpruned Nature’s gifts, the stillness and
the privacy, as if there were only those two beings in the world,
made for each other, and with this world of beauty for the scene of
their delights. It is a Heaven descended upon earth, as if the finger
of God had planted the garden with trees and fruits and flowers, and
his hand had watered it! One fault only can be found by the critical
eye. Perhaps the scene is too flat. If the ‘verdurous wall of
Paradise’ had upreared itself behind our first parents, it would have
closed them in more completely, and would have given effect to the
blue hills that gleam enchantment in the distance. Opposite, ‘in
darkness visible,’ hangs the famous landscape of the Deluge by the
same master-hand, a leaden weight on the walls with the ark ‘<em>hulling</em>’
on the distant flood, the sun labouring, wan and faint, up the sky,
and the heavens, ‘blind with rain,’ pouring down their total cisterns
on the weltering earth. Men and women and different animals are
struggling with the wide-spread desolation; and trees, climbing the
sides of rocks, seem patiently awaiting it above. One would think
Lord Byron had transcribed his admirable account of the Deluge in
his <cite>Heaven and Earth</cite> from this noble picture, which is in truth the
very poetry of painting.—One here finds also the more unequivocal
productions of the French school (for Claude and Poussin<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a> were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>a great measure Italian,) Le Brun, Sebastian Bourdon, some of Le
Sueur’s expressive faces, and the bland expansive style of Philip
Champagne—no mean name in the history of art. See, in particular,
the exquisite picture of the Sick Nun, (the Nun was his own
daughter, and he painted this picture as a present to the Convent, in
gratitude for her recovery,)—and another of a Religious Communion,
with attendants in rich dresses.</p>

<p class='c000'>One finds no considerable gap, till one comes to the Antwerp
pictures; and this yawning chasm is not ill supplied by the Luxembourg
pictures, those splendid solecisms of Rubens’s art. Never was
exhibited a greater union of French flutter and Gothic grace, of
borrowed absurdity and inherent power. He has made a strange
jumble of the Heathen mythology, his own wives, and the mistresses
of Louis XIII. His youthful Gods are painted all light and air, and
figure in quaintly enough, with some flaunting Dowager dressed in
the height of the fashion in the middle of the 17th century, or with
some strapping quean (his queens are queans) with her robes of rich
stuffs slipping off her shoulders, and displaying limbs that, both for
form and hue, provoke any feeling but indifference. His groups
spring from the bold licentious hand of genius; and decorated in the
preposterous finery of courtly affectation, puzzle the sense. I do not
think with David (the celebrated French painter) that they ought to
be burnt, but he has himself got possession of their old places in the
Luxembourg, and perhaps he is tolerably satisfied with this arrangement.
A landscape with a rainbow by Rubens (a rich and dazzling
piece of colouring) that used to occupy a recess half-way down the
Louvre, was removed to the opposite side. The singular picture
(the Defeat of Goliath, by Daniel Volterra,) painted on both sides
on slate, still retained its station in the middle of the room. It had
hung there for twenty years unmolested. The Rembrandts keep
their old places, and are as fine as ever, with their rich enamel, their
thick lumps of colour, their startling gloom, and bold execution—their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>ear-rings, their gold-chains, and fur-collars, on which one is
disposed to lay furtive hands, so much have they the look of wealth
and substantial use! The Vandykes are more light and airy than
ever. There is a whole heap of them; and among the rest that
charming portrait of an English lady with a little child (as fine and
true a compliment as was ever paid to the English female character,)
sustained by sweetness and dignity, but with a mother’s anxious
thoughts passing slightly across her serene brow. The Cardinal
Bentivoglio (which I remember procuring especial permission to
copy, and left untouched, because, after Titian’s portraits, there was
a want of interest in Vandyke’s which I could not get over,) is not
there.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> But in the Dutch division, I found Weenix’s game, the
battle-pieces of Wouvermans, and Ruysdael’s sparkling woods and
waterfalls without number. On these (I recollect as if it were
yesterday) I used, after a hard day’s work, and having tasked my
faculties to the utmost, to cast a mingled glance of surprise and
pleasure, as the light gleamed upon them through the high casement,
and to take leave of them with a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non equidem invideo, miror magis</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the third or Italian division of the Gallery, there is a profusion
of Albanos, with Cupids and naked Nymphs, which are quite in the
old French taste. They are certainly very pleasing compositions,
but from the change produced by time, the figures shew like beauty-spots
on a dark ground. How inferior is he to Guido, the painter
of grace and sentiment, two of whose master-pieces enchanted me
anew, the Annunciation and the Presentation in the Temple. In
each of these there is a tenderness, a delicacy of expression like the
purest affection, and every attitude and turn of a limb is conscious
elegance and voluptuous refinement. The pictures, the mind of the
painter, are instinct and imbued with beauty. It is worth while to
have lived to have produced works like these, or even to have seen
and felt their power! Painting of old was a language which its
disciples used not merely to denote certain objects, but to unfold their
hidden meaning, and to convey the finest movements of the soul into
the limbs or features of the face. They looked at nature with a
feeling of passion, with an eye to expression; and this it was that,
while they sought for outward forms to communicate their feelings,
moulded them into truth and beauty, and that surrounds them with an
atmosphere of thought and sentiment. To admire a fine old picture
is itself an act of devotion, and as we gaze, we turn idolaters. The
moderns are chiefly intent on giving certain lines and colours, the
<em>mask</em> or material face of painting, and leave out the immortal part of
it. Thus a modern Exhibition Room (whether French or English)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>has a great deal of shew and glitter, and a smell of paint in it. In
the Louvre we are thrown back into the presence of our own best
thoughts and feelings, the highest acts and emanations of the mind of
man breathe from the walls, shadowy tears and sighs there keep vigils,
and the air within it is divine!</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>ideal</em> is no less observable in the portraits than in the histories
here. Look at the portrait of a man in black, by Titian (No.
1210). There is a tongue in that eye, a brain beneath that forehead.
It is still; but the hand seems to have been just placed on its
side; it does not turn its head, but it looks towards you to ask,
whether you recognise it or not? It was there to meet me, after an
interval of years, as if I had parted with it the instant before. Its
keen, steadfast glance staggered me like a blow. It was the same—how
was I altered! I pressed towards it, as it were, to throw off a
load of doubt from the mind, or as having burst through the obstacles
of time and distance that had held me in torturing suspense. I do
not know whether this is not the most striking picture in the room—the
least <em>common-place</em>. There may be other pictures more delightful
to look at; but this seems, like the eye of the Collection, to be
looking at you and them. One might be tempted to go up and speak
to it! The allegorical portrait of the Marchioness of Guasto is still
here, transparent with tenderness and beauty—Titian’s Mistress, that
shines like a crystal mirror—the Entombing of Christ, solemn,
harmonious as the coming on of evening—the Disciples at Emmaus—and
the Crowning with Thorns, the blood here and there seeming
ready to start through the flesh-colour, which even English artists
have not known enough how to admire. The Young Man’s Head,
with a glove that used so much to delight, I confess, disappointed
me, and I am convinced must have been painted upon. There are
other Titians, and a number of Raphaels—the Head of a Student
muffled in thought—his own delightful Head (leaning on its hand)
redolent of youthful genius, and several small Holy Families, full of
the highest spirit and unction. There are also the three Marys with
the Dead Body of Christ, by L. Caracci; the Salutation by Sebastian
del Piombo; the noble Hunting-piece, by Annibal Caracci; the fine
Landscapes of Domenichino (that in particular of the story of
Hercules and Achelous, with the trunk of a tree left in the bed of a
mountain-torrent); and a host besides, ‘thick as the autumnal leaves
that strew the brooks in Vallombrosa,’ and of the same colour!
There are so many of these select and favourite pictures left, that one
does not all at once feel the loss of others which are more common
in prints and in the mouth of fame; and the absence of which may
be considered as almost an advantage for a first recognition and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>revival of old associations. But afterwards we find a want of larger
pictures to answer to the magnitude of the Collection, and to sustain
the balance of taste between the Italian and the other schools. We
have here as fine Claudes and Poussins as any in the world, but not
as fine Raphaels, Correggios, Domenichinos, as there are elsewhere,—as
were once here. There are wanting, to make the gallery
complete, six or eight capital pictures, the Transfiguration, the St.
Peter Martyr, &amp;c.; and among others (not already mentioned,) the
Altarpiece of St. Mark, by Tintoret, and Paul Veronese’s Marriage
at Cana. With these it had been perfect, ‘founded as the rock, as
broad and general as the casing air;’ without these it is ‘coop’d and
cabin’d in by saucy doubts and fears.’ The largest Collection in the
world ought to be colossal, not only in itself, but in its component
parts. The Louvre is a quarter of a mile in length, and equal (as it
is) to Mr. Angerstein’s, the Marquess of Stafford’s, the Dulwich
Gallery, and Blenheim put together. It was once more than equal
to them in every circumstance to inspire genius or console reflection.
We still see the palace of the Thuilleries from the windows, with the
white flag waving over it: but we look in vain for the Brazen Horses
on its gates, or him who placed them there, or the pale bands of
warriors that conquered in the name of liberty and of their country!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class='c008'>The gravity of the French character is a no less remarkable (though
a less obvious) feature in it than its levity. The last is the quality
that strikes us most by contrast to ourselves, and that comes most
into play in the intercourse of common life; and therefore we are
generally disposed to set them down as an altogether frivolous and
superficial people. It is a mistake which we shall do well to correct
on farther acquaintance with them; or if we persist in it, we must
call to our aid an extraordinary degree of our native blindness and
obstinacy. We ought never to visit their Theatres, to walk along
their streets, to enter their houses, to look in their faces (when they
do not think themselves observed,) to open their books, or take a
view of their picture-galleries. Sterne seems to have been the first,
as well as last traveller, who found out their weak side in this respect.
‘If the French have a fault, Monsieur le Comte,’ says he, ‘it is that
they are too serious.’ This contradiction in their character has been
little noticed, and they have never had the credit of it, though it
stares one in the face everywhere. How we are to piece the two
extremes together is another question. Is it that their whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>character is a system of <em>inconsequentiality</em>? Or are they gay and
trifling in serious matters, serious only in trifles? Or are their minds
more of the cameleon-cast, that reflects all objects alike, whether
grave or gay, and give themselves up entirely, and without resistance,
to the prevailing impulse? Or is it owing to a want of comprehension,
so that they are incapable of correcting one feeling by another, and
thus run into extremes? Or that they have a greater scope and
variety of resources, excelling us as much in gravity as in want of
thought, outdoing us in tragedy and comedy, as they betake themselves
to each, in the poetical or in the prosaic departments of life,
only that they sometimes make a transposition of the two characters
a little oddly, and pass from the one to the other without our well
knowing why?</p>

<p class='c000'>I have been frequently puzzled with this exception to the butterfly,
airy, thoughtless, fluttering character of the French (on which we
compliment ourselves,) and never more so than the first night I went
to the theatre. The order, the attention, the decorum were such as
would shame any London audience. The attention was more like
that of a learned society to a lecture on some scientific subject, than
of a promiscuous crowd collected together merely for amusement, and
to pass away an idle hour. There was a professional air, an unvarying
gravity in the looks and demeanour of the whole assembled multitude,
as if every one had an immediate interest in the character of the
national poetry, in the purity of the French accent, in the propriety
of the declamation, in the conceptions of the actor, and the developement
of the story, instead of its presenting a mob of idle boys and
girls, of ignorant gaping citizens, or supercilious box-lobby loungers,
affecting a contempt for the performance, and for every one around
them. The least noise or irregularity called forth the most instant
and lively disapprobation; and the vivacity of the French character
displayed itself to advantage in earnest gesticulations and expressions
of impatience. Not only was the strictest silence observed, as soon
as the curtain drew up, but no one moved or attempted to move.
The spell thrown over the customary or supposed restlessness and
volatility of the French was in this respect complete. The uniformity
of the appearance was indeed almost ridiculous; for the rows of heads
in the seats of the pit no more stirred or projected the breadth of a
finger beyond the line, than those of a regiment of recruits on parade,
or than if a soldier were stationed to keep each chin in its place.
They may be reduced to the state of automatons; but there were no
traces of the <em>monkey</em> character left.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a> If the performance had been <em>at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Court</em>, greater propriety could not have been maintained; but it was
a French play (one of Racine’s) and acted before a Parisian
audience: this seemed to be enough to ensure it a proper reception.
One would suppose, from their interest in dramatic representations,
that the French were a nation of actors. Perhaps it may be asked,
‘Is not that the case? and is it not their vanity, their own desire to
shine, or their sympathy with whatever or whoever is a candidate for
applause, that accounts for their behaviour?’ At least, their vanity
makes them <em>grave</em>; and if it is this which rivets their attention, and
silences their eternal loquacity, it must be allowed to produce effects
which others would do well to imitate from better motives, if they
have them!<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The play was not much; but there seemed to be an abstract
interest felt in the stage as such, in the sound of the verse, in the
measured step of the actors, in the recurrence of the same pauses, and
of the same ideas; in the correctness of the costume, in the very
notion of the endeavour after excellence, and in the creation of an
artificial and imaginary medium of thought. If the French are more
susceptible of immediate, sensible impressions, it would appear,
judging from their behaviour at their own theatres, that they are also
more sensible of reflex and refined ones. The bare suggestion of an
interesting topic is to them interesting: it may be said, on the most
distant intimation, to excite the most lively concern, and to collect
their scattered spirits into a focus. Their sensibility takes the alarm
more easily; their understanding is quicker of hearing. With them,
to the sublime or pathetic there is but one step—the <em>name</em>; the
moment the subject is started, they ‘jump at’ the catastrophe and all
the consequences. We are slow, and must have a thing made out to
us in striking instances, and by successive blows. We are sluggish,
and must be lifted up to the heights of a factitious enthusiasm by the
complicated machinery of a powerful imagination: we are obstinate,
not to say selfish, and require to be urged over the abyss of mental
anguish by the utmost violence of terror and pity. But with the
French, all this is a matter of course, a verbal process. Tears, as
well as smiles, cost them less than they do us. Words are more
nearly allied to things in their minds; the one have a more vital
being, though it does not follow that the other are altogether empty
and barren of interest. But the French seem (in their dramatic
exhibitions) not to wish to get beyond, or (shall I speak it more
plainly?) to have no faculty for getting beyond the abstract conception,
the naked proposition of the subject. They are a people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>(I repeat it) void and bare of the faculty of imagination, if by this
we mean the power of placing things in the most novel and striking
point of view; and they are so for this reason, that they have no need
of it. It is to them a superfluity—a thankless toil. Their quick,
discursive apprehension runs on before, and anticipates and defeats
the efforts of the highest poetry. They are contented to indulge in
all the agony or ecstacy of sounding and significant common-places.
The words <em>charming</em>, <em>delicious</em>, <em>indescribable</em>, &amp;c. excite the same
lively emotions in their minds as the most vivid representations of
what is said to be so; and hence verbiage and the cant of sentiment
fill the place, and stop the road to genius—a vague, flaccid, enervated
rhetoric being too often substituted for the pith and marrow of truth
and nature. The greatest facility to feel or to comprehend will not
produce the most intense passion, or the most electrical expression of
it. There must be a resistance in the matter to do this—a collision,
an obstacle to overcome. The torrent rushes with fury from being
impeded in its course: the lightning splits the gnarled oak. There
is no malice in this statement; but I should think they may themselves
allow it to be an English version of the truth, containing a
great deal that is favourable to them, with a saving clause for our own
use. The long (and to us tiresome) speeches in French tragedy
consist of a string of emphatic and well-balanced lines, announcing
general maxims and indefinite sentiments applicable to human life.
The poet seldom commits any excesses by giving way to his own
imagination, or identifying himself with individual situations and
sufferings. We are not now raised to the height of passion, now
plunged into its lowest depths; the whole finds its level, like
water, in the liquid, yielding susceptibility of the French character,
and in the unembarrassed scope of the French intellect. The finest
line in Racine, that is, in French poetry, is by common consent
understood to be the following:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Craignez Dieu, mon cher Abner, et ne craignez que Dieu.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>That is, <em>Fear God, my dear Abner, and fear only him</em>. A pious and
just exhortation, it is true; but, when this is referred to as the highest
point of elevation to which their dramatic genius has aspired, though
we may not be warranted in condemning their whole region of poetry
as a barren waste, we may consider it as very nearly a level plain,
and assert, that though the soil contains mines of useful truths within
its bosom and glitters with the graces of a polished style, it does not
abound in picturesque points of view or romantic interest! It is
certain that a thousand such lines would have no effect upon an
English audience but to set them to sleep, like a sermon, or to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>them commence a disturbance to avoid it. Yet, though the declamation
of the French stage is as monotonous as the dialogue, the French
listen to it with the tears in their eyes, holding in their breath,
beating time to the cadence of the verse, and following the actors
with a book in their hands for hours together. The English most
assuredly do not pay the same attention to a play of Shakspeare’s, or
to any thing but a cock-fight or a sparring-match. This is no great
compliment to them; but it makes for the gravity of the French, who
have mistaken didactic for dramatic poetry, who can sit out a play
with the greatest patience and complacency, that an Englishman
would hoot off the stage, or yawn over from beginning to end for its
want of striking images and lively effect, and with whom Saturn is a
God no less than Mercury! I am inclined to suspect the genius of
their religion may have something to do with the genius of their
poetry. The first absorbs in a manner their powers of imagination,
their love of the romantic and the marvellous, and leaves the last in
possession of their sober reason and moral sense. Their churches
are theatres; their theatres are like churches. Their fancies are
satiated with the mummeries and pageantry of the Catholic faith, with
hieroglyphic obscurity and quaint devices; and, when they come to
the tangible ground of human affairs, they are willing to repose alike
from ornament and extravagance, in plain language and intelligible
ideas. They go to mass in the morning to dazzle their senses, and
bewilder their imagination, and inflame their enthusiasm; and they
resort to the theatre in the evening to seek relief from superstitious
intoxication in the prose of poetry, and from Gothic mysteries and
gloom, in classic elegance and costume. Be this as it may, the love
of the French for Racine is not a feeling of the moment, or left
behind them at the theatres; they can quote him by heart, and his
sententious, admirable lines occupy the next place in their minds to
their <em>amatory poetry</em>. There is nothing unpleasant in a French theatre
but a certain infusion of <em>soup-maigre</em> into the composition of the air,
(so that one inhales a kind of thin pottage,) and an oily dinginess
in the complexions both of the men and women, which shews more
by lamp-light. It is not true (as has been said) that their theatres
are nearly dark, or that the men stand in the pit. It is true, none
but men are admitted into it, but they have seats just the same as
with us, and a curious custom of securing their places when they go
out, by binding their handkerchiefs round them, so that at the end of
the play the benches presented nothing but a row of knotted pocket
handkerchiefs. Almost every one returned and sat out the entertainment,
which was not a farce, but a sentimental comedy, and a
very charming one too, founded on the somewhat national subject of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>a seduction by an English nobleman in France, and in which the fair
sufferer was represented by a young <em>debutante</em>, in natural expression
and pathos little inferior to Miss Kelly, (as far as we can translate
French into English nature,) but fatter and prettier. So much for
their taste in theatricals, which does not incline wholly to puppet-shows
and gew-gaws. The Theatre, in short, is the Throne of the
French character, where it is mounted on its pedestal of pride, and
seen to every advantage. I like to contemplate it there, for it
reconciles me to them and to myself. It is a common and amicable
ground on which we meet. Their tears are such as others shed—their
interest in what happened three thousand years ago is not
exclusively French. They are no longer a distinct race or <em>caste</em>, but
human beings. To feel towards others as of a different species, is
not the way to increase our respect for ourselves or human nature.
Their defects and peculiarities, we may be almost sure, have corresponding
opposite vices in us—the excellences are confined pretty
much to what there is in common.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ordinary prejudice entertained on this subject in England is,
that the French are little better than grown children—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pleas’d with a feather—tickled with a straw—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>full of grimace and noise and shew, lively and pert, but with no turn
or capacity for serious thought or continued attention of any kind,
and hardly deserving the name of rational beings, any more than apes
or jackdaws. They may laugh and talk more than the English;
but they read, and, I suspect, think more, taking them as a people.
You see an apple-girl in Paris, sitting at a stall with her feet over a
stove in the coldest weather, or defended from the sun by an umbrella,
reading Racine or Voltaire. Who ever saw such a thing in London
as a barrow-woman reading Shakspeare or Fielding? You see a
handsome, smart <em>grisette</em> at the back of every little shop or counter in
Paris, if she is not at work, reading perhaps one of Marmontel’s
Tales, with all the absorption and delicate interest of a heroine of
romance. Yet we make doleful complaints of the want of education
among the common people, and of the want of reflection in the
female character in France. There is something of the same turn
for reading in Scotland; but then where is the gaiety or the grace?
They are more sour and formal even than the English. The book-stalls
all over Paris present a very delightful appearance. They
contain neatly-bound, cheap, and portable editions of all their standard
authors, which of itself refutes the charge of a want of the knowledge
or taste for books. The French read with avidity whenever they
can snatch the opportunity. They read standing in the open air, into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>which they are driven by the want of air at home. They read in
garrets and in cellars. They read at one end of a counter, when
a person is hammering a lock or a piece of cabinet-work at the other,
without taking their eye from the book, or picking a quarrel with the
person who is making the noise. Society is the school of education in
France; there is a transparency in their intellects as in their atmosphere,
which makes the communication of thought or sound more
rapid and general. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">farina</span></i> of knowledge floats in the air, and
circulates at random. Alas! it ‘quickens, even with blowing.’ A
periwig-maker is an orator; a fish-woman is a moralist; a woman of
fashion is a metaphysician, armed with all the topics; a pretty woman
in Paris, who was not also a <em>blue-stocking</em>, would make little figure in
the circles. It would be in vain for her to know how to dispose
a knot of ribands or a bunch of flowers in her hair, unless she could
arrange a critical and analytical argument in all the forms. It is
nothing against her, if she excels in personal and mental accomplishments
at the same time. This turn for literary or scientific topics in
the women may indeed be accounted for in part from the modes of
social intercourse in France; but what does this very circumstance
prove, but that an interchange of ideas is considered as one great
charm in the society between men and women, and that the thirst of
knowledge is not banished by a grosser passion? Knowledge and
reason, however, descend; and where the women are philosophers,
the men are not quite block-heads or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitres</span></i>. They are far from
being the ignorant smatterers that we pretend. They are not backward
at asking for reasons, nor slow in giving them. They have
a theory for every thing, even for vice and folly. Their faces again
are grave and serious when they are by themselves, as they are gay
and animated in society. Their eyes have a vacant, absent stare;
their features set or lengthen all at once into ‘the melancholy of
Moorditch.’ The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i> of the Diligence from Rouen confirmed
me agreeably in my theory of the philosophical character of the
French physiognomy. With large grey eyes and drooping eye-lids,
prominent distended nostrils, a fine Fenelon expression of countenance,
and a mouth open and eloquent, with furrowed lines twisted round it
like whip-cord, he stood on the steps of the coach, and harangued to the
gentlemen within on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bêtise</span></i> of some <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voyageur Anglois</span></i> with the air
of a professor, and in a deep sonorous voice, worthy of an oration of
Bossuet. I should like to hear a Yorkshire guard, with his bluff,
red face, bristly bullet head, little peering eyes, round shoulders, and
squeaking voice, ascend into an imaginary rostrum in this manner,
wave a florid speculation in one hand, and hold fast by the coach-door
with the other, or get beyond an oath, a hearty curse, or his shrewd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>country gibberish! The face of the French soldiery is a face of
great humanity—it is manly, sedate, thoughtful—it is equally free
from fierceness and stupidity; and it seems to bear in its eye defeat
and victory, the eagle and the lilies! I cannot help adding here,
that a French gentleman (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un Rentier</span></i>) who lodges in the hotel
opposite to me, passes his time in reading all the morning, dines, plays
with his children after dinner, and takes a hand at backgammon with
an old <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</span></i> in the evening. He does not figure away with a
couple of horses in the streets like our English <em>jockeys</em> (who really are
nothing without a footman behind them,) nor does his wife plague his
life out to run after all the new sights. And yet they are from the
country. This looks like domestic comfort and internal resources.
How many disciples of Rousseau’s <cite>Emilius</cite> are there in France at the
present day? I knew one twenty years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French are a people who practise the arts and sciences
naturally. A shoe-black is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">artiste du jour</span></i> (artist of the day,) and
a rat-catcher approaches you under some insidious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de guerre</span></i>.
Every thing is with them imposing, grave, important. ‘Except (it
may be said) what really is so;’ and it may be insinuated, that all
their pretensions are equally idly mockery and grimace. Look,
then, at their works of science and of art—the one the most comprehensive
and exact, the other the most laborious and finished in the
world. What are their chemists, their astronomers, their naturalists,
their painters, their sculptors? If not the greatest and most inventive
geniuses, the most accurate compilers, and the most severe students in
their several departments. La Place, Lavoisier, Cuvier, David,
Houdon, are not triflers or pretenders. In science, if we have
discovered the principles, they have gone more into the details—in
art we accuse them of being over-laboured, and of finishing too
minutely and mechanically; and they charge us (justly enough) with
a want of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finesse</span></i>, and with producing little more than rude sketches
and abortive caricatures. Their frigid, anatomical inquiries—their
studies after the antique, and acquaintance with all the professional
and scientific branches of their art, are notorious—and the care with
which they work up their draperies and back-grounds is obvious to
every one, and a standing subject of complaint and ridicule to English
artists and critics. Their refinement in art, I confess, consists chiefly
in an attention to rules and details, but then it does imply an attention
to these, which is contrary to our idea of the flighty French character.
I remember, some years ago, a young French artist in the Louvre,
who was making a chalk-drawing of a small <cite>Virgin and Child</cite>, by
Leonardo da Vinci, and he took eleven weeks to complete it, sitting
with his legs astride over a railing, looking up and talking to those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>about him—consulting their opinion as to his unwearied imperceptible
progress—going to the fire to warm his hands, and returning to
<em>perfectionate himself</em>! There was a good deal of ‘laborious foolery’
in all this, but still he kept on with it, and did not fly to fifty things
one after the other. Another student had undertaken to copy the
<cite>Titian’s Mistress</cite>, and the method he took to do it was to parcel out
his canvass into squares like an engraver; after which he began very
deliberately, not with the face or hair, but with the first square in the
right-hand corner of the picture, containing a piece of an old table.
He did not care where he began, so that he went through the whole
regularly. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est égal</span></i>, is the common reply in all such cases. This
continuity of purpose, without any great effort or deep interest,
surprises an Englishman. We can do nothing without a strong motive,
and without violent exertion. But it is this very circumstance
probably that enables them to proceed: they take the matter quite
easily, and have not the same load of anxious thought to bear up
against, nor the same impatient eagerness to reach perfection at a
single stride, to stop them midway. They have not the English air
hanging at their backs, like the Old Man of the Sea at Sinbad’s!
The same freedom from any thing like morbid humour assists them to
plod on like the Dutch from mere phlegm, or to diverge into a variety
of pursuits, which is still more natural to them. Horace Vernet has
in the present Exhibition a portrait of a lady, (a rival to Sir T.
Lawrence’s) and close to it, a battle-piece, equal to Ward or Cooper.
Who would not be a Parisian born, to attain excellence with the
wish to succeed from mere confidence or indifference to success, to
unite such a number of accomplishments, or be equally satisfied
without a single one!</p>

<p class='c000'>The English are over-hasty in supposing a certain lightness and
petulance of manner in the French to be incompatible with sterling
thought or steady application, and flatter themselves that not to be
merry is to be wise. A French lady who had married an Englishman
remarkable for his dullness, used to apologise for his silence in
company by incessantly repeating ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est toujours Locke, toujours
Newton</span></i>,’ as if these were the subjects that occupied his thoughts.
It is well we have these names to appeal to in all cases of emergency;
and as far as mere gravity is concerned, let these celebrated persons
have been as wise as they would, they could not for the life of them
have appeared duller or more stupid than the generality of their
countrymen. The chief advantage I can find in the English over
the French comes to this, that though slower, if they once take a
thing up, they are longer in laying it down, provided it is a grievance
or a <em>sore subject</em>. The reason is, that the French do not delight in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>grievances or in sore subjects; and that the English delight in nothing
else, and battle their way through them most manfully. Their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i> is
the disagreeable and repulsive. I think they would have fought the
battle of Waterloo over again! The English, besides being ‘good
haters,’ are dogged and downright, and have no salvos for their
self-love. Their vanity does not heal the wounds made in their
pride. The French, on the contrary, are soon reconciled to fate, and
so enamoured of their own idea, that nothing can put them out of
conceit with it. Whatever their attachment to their country, to
liberty or glory, they are not so affected by the loss of these as to
make any desperate effort or sacrifice to recover them. Their
continuity of feeling is such, as to be no enemy to a whole skin.
They over-ran Europe like tigers, and defended their own territory like
deer. They are a nation of heroes—on this side of martyrdom!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class='c008'>DIALOGUE, FRENCH AND ENGLISH</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—Have you seen the whole of our <em>Exposition</em> of the present
year?—</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—No, but I have looked over a good part of it. I have
been much pleased with many of the pictures. As far as I can judge,
or have a right to say so, I think your artists have improved within
these few years.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—Perhaps so, occasionally, but we have not David and
some others.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—I cannot say that I miss him much. He had, I dare
say, many excellences, but his faults were still more glaring, according
to our insular notions of the art. Have you Guerin now? He
had just brought out his first picture of Phædra and Hippolitus when
I was in Paris formerly. It made a prodigious sensation at the time,
and very great things were expected from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—No, his works are not much spoken of.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—The Hippolitus in the picture I speak of was very
beautiful; but the whole appeared too much cast in the mould of the
antique, and it struck me then that there was a <em>mannerism</em> about
it that did not augur favourably for his future progress, but denoted
a premature perfection. What I like in your present Exhibition is,
that you seem in a great measure to have left this academic manner,
and to have adopted a more natural style.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>French.—I do not exactly comprehend.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Why, you know the English complain of French art as
too laboured and mechanical, as not allowing scope enough for genius
and originality, as you retort upon us for being coarse and rustic.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—Ah! I understand. <em>There</em> is a picture in the English
style; the subject is a Greek massacre, by Rouget. It is an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ébauche</span></i>.
It is for effect. There is much spirit in the expression, and a boldness
of execution, but every part is not finished. It is like a first
sketch, or like the painting of the scenes at our theatres. He has
another picture here.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Yes, of great merit in the same style of dashing, off-hand,
explosive effect. He is something between our Ward and
Haydon. But that is not what I mean. I do not wish you to
exchange your vices for ours. We are not as yet models in the <span class='sc'>Fine
Arts</span>. I am only glad that you imitate us, as it is a sign you begin
to feel a certain deficiency in yourselves. There is no necessity for
grossness and extravagance, any more than for being finical or
pedantic. Now there is a picture yonder, which I think has broken
through the trammels of the modern French school, without forfeiting
its just pretensions to classical history. It has the name of
Drölling on it. What, pray, is the subject of it?</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—It is <cite>Ulysses conducting Polyxena to the sacrifice</cite>. He has
one much better at the Luxembourg.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—I don’t know; I have not seen that, but this picture
appears to me to be a very favourable specimen of the present French
school. It has great force, considerable beauty, symmetry of form,
and expression; and it is animated flesh, not coloured stone. The
action and gestures into which the figures throw themselves, seem the
result of life and feeling, and not of putting casts after the antique into
Opera attitudes.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—We do not think much of that picture. It has not been
perfected.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Perhaps it passes a certain conventional limit, and is
borne away by the impulse of the subject; and of that the most
eminent among the French artists might be thought to be as much
afraid as the old lady at Court was that her face would fall in pieces,
if her features relaxed into a smile. The Ulysses is poor and stiff:
the nurse might be finer; but I like the faces of the two foremost
figures much; they are handsome, interesting, and the whole female
group is alive and in motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—What do you think of the picture by Gerard, No. 745,
of the <cite>Meeting between Louis XIV. and the Spanish Ambassador</cite>? It
is greatly admired here.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>English.—It appeared to me (as I passed it just now) to be a
picture of great bustle and spirit; and it looks as if Iris had dipped
her woof in it, the dresses are so gay and fine. Really, the show of
variegated colours in the principal group is like a bed of tulips.
That is certainly a capitally painted head of a priest stooping forward
in a red cap and mantle.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—And the youth near him no less.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—The complexion has too much the texture of fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—But for the composition—the contrast between youth
and age is so justly marked. Are you not struck with the figure of
the Spanish Ambassador? His black silk drapery is quite in the
Italian style.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—I thought Gerard had been chiefly admired for a certain
delicacy of expression, more than for his colouring or costume. He
was a favourite painter of the Empress Josephine.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—But in the present subject there is not much scope for
expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—It is very true; but in a picture of the same crowded
and courtly character (<cite>The last Moments of Henry IV.</cite>,) the painter
has contrived to introduce a great deal of beauty and tenderness of
expression in the appearance of some of the youthful attendants.
<em>This</em> is a more shewy and finely painted drawing-room picture; but
<em>that</em> appears to me to have more character in it. It has also the merit
of being finished with great care. I think the French excel in small
histories of the domestic or ornamental kind. Here, for instance, is
a very pretty picture by Madame Hersent, 897, <cite>Louis XIV. taking
leave of his Grand-child</cite>. It is well painted, the dresses are rich and
correct—the monarch has a great deal of negligent dignity mixed
with the feebleness of age, the contrast of innocence and freshness in
the child is well-managed, and the attendants are decayed beauties
and very confidential-looking persons of that period. One great
charm of all historical subjects is, to carry us back to the scene and
time, which this picture does. Probably from the Age and Court of
Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> to that of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> it is not far for a French imagination
to transport itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—Monsieur, it is so far that we should never have got
from the one to the other, if you had not helped us.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—So much the worse! But do you not think that a clever
picture of the <cite>Interior of a Gothic Ruin</cite>, 247, (Bouton.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a>) It seems
to me as if the artist had been reading Sir Walter Scott. That
lofty, ruinous cave looks out on the wintry sea from one of the
Shetland Isles. There is a cold, desolate look of horror pervading it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to the utmost extremity. But the finishing is, perhaps, somewhat too
exact for so wild a scene. Has not the snow, lodged on the broken
ledges of the rocks, a little of the appearance of the coat of candied
sugar on a twelfth-cake? But how comes the dog in possession of
so smart a kennel? It is said in the Catalogue, that by his barking
he alarms his master, who saves the poor woman and her infant from
perishing. Who would have thought that such a scene as this had
a master?</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—Dogs are necessary everywhere in France: there is no
place that we can keep them out of. They are like the machines in
ancient poetry—a part of every plot. Poodles are the true <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désirs</span></i><a id='t125'></a>:
they have ousted even the priests. They may soon set up a
hierarchy of their own. They swarm, and are as filthy as an
Egyptian religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—But this is a house-dog, not a lap-dog.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—There is no saying—but pass on. Is there any other
picture that you like?</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Yes, I am much pleased with the one opposite, the
<cite>Marriage of the Virgin</cite>, 268, by Mons. Caminade. It is both
elegant and natural. The Virgin kneels in a simple and expressive
attitude; in the children there is a playful and healthy aspect, and
the grouping is quite like a classic bas-relief. Perhaps, in this respect,
it wants depth. Can you tell me, why French painting so much
affects the qualities of sculpture in general,—flatness and formality in
the groups, and hardness of outline in the single figures?</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—I cannot answer that question, as it is some time since
I left England, where I remained only ten months to perfect myself
in the language. You probably think more highly of the next
picture: <cite>The Establishment of the Enfans Trouvés</cite>, by M——?</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—I am afraid not; for it has the old French flimsiness
and flutter. The face of the Foundress resembles a shower of
roseate tints. You may be sure, however, that the English in
general will approve mightily of it, who like all subjects of charitable
institutions. I heard an English lady just now in raptures with the
naked children seated on the blankets, calling them affectionately,
‘poor little dears!’ We like subjects of want, because they afford
a relief to our own sense of comfortlessness, and subjects of
benevolence, because they soothe our sense of self-importance—a
feeling of which we stand greatly in need.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—What is your opinion of the portrait of Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span>, by
Gerard?</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—It seems to have been painted after dinner, and as if his
Majesty was uneasy in his seat—the boots might have been spared.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>French.—We have a picture by one of your compatriots—the
Chevalier Lawrence—</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Yes, the portrait of a Lady, in the next room. It was
accounted one of the best portraits in our Somerset-house Exhibition
last summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—But there is a portrait of a French Lady, placed as a
companion to it, by Horace Vernet, which is thought better.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—I have no doubt. But I believe, in England, the
preference would be given the contrary way.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—May I ask on what ground, Sir?</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Let me ask, did you ever happen to sit to have a cast of
your head taken? Because I conceive that precisely the same heated,
smooth, oily, close, stifling feeling that one’s face has just before
the mask is taken off, is that which is conveyed by the texture and
look of a finished French portrait, generally speaking, and by this in
particular. I like the Head of a Lady, by Guerin (838), on the
opposite side of the room, better. It is clear, cold, blue and white,
with an airy attitude, and firm drawing. There is no attempt to
smother one with dingy flesh <em>rouged</em> over.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—But have you seen our miniatures? The English
miniatures, I imagine, are not good.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—At least, we have a good many of them. I know an
English critic, who would at least count you up thirty eminent
English miniature-painters at a breath,—all first-rate geniuses; so
differently do we view these things on different sides of the Channel!
In truth, all miniatures must be much alike. There can be no such
thing as an <em>English miniature</em>, that is, as a coarse, slovenly daub in
little. We finish when we cannot help it. We do not volunteer a
host of graces, like you; but we can make a virtue of necessity.
There was a Mr. Hayter, who painted resplendent miniatures,
perfect mirrors of the highest heaven of beauty; but he preferred the
English liberty of sign-post painting in oil. I observe among your
miniatures several enamels and copies from the Old Masters in the
Louvre. Has not the coming to them the effect of looking through
a window? What a breadth, what a clearness, what a solidity?
How do you account for this superiority? I do not say this
invidiously, for I confess it is the same, whenever copies are
introduced by stealth in our English Exhibition.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—I perceive, Sir, you have a prejudice in favour of the
English style of art.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—None at all; but I cannot think our faults any justification
of yours, or yours of ours. For instance, here is a landscape by
a countryman of mine, Mr. Constable (No. 358). Why then all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>this affectation of dashing lights and broken tints and straggling lumps
of paint, which I dare say give the horrors to a consummate French
artist? On the other hand, why do not your artists try to give
something of the same green, fresh, and healthy look of living nature,
without smearing coats of varnish over raw <em>dabs</em> of colour (as we
do), till the composition resembles the ice breaking up in marshy
ground after a frosty morning? Depend upon it, in disputes about
taste, as in other quarrels, there are faults on both sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—The English style has effect, but it is gross.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—True: yet in the inner rooms there are some water-colour
landscapes, by Copley Fielding, which strike me as uniting
effect with delicacy, particularly No. 360, with some beautiful trees
fringing the fore-ground. I think our painters do best when they
are cramped in the vehicle they employ. They are abusers of oil-colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—I recollect the name; but his works did not seem to
me to be finished.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—They are finished as nature is finished: that is, the
details are to be found in them, though they do not obtrude themselves.
You French require every thing to be made out like pin’s
points or botanic specimens of leaves and trees. Your histories want
life, and your landscapes air. I could have sworn the little fishing-piece
(No. —) was English. It is such a daub, and yet has such a
feeling of out-of-door scenery in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—You do not flatter us. But you allow our excellence in
sculpture.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—There is an admirable study of a little girl going into a
bath, by Jacquot. It is so simple, true, and expressive, I thought it
might be Chantry’s. I cannot say I saw any others that pleased me.
The Eurydice, by Nantreuil, is a French Eurydice. It is an elegantly-formed
female, affecting trifling airs and graces in the agonies of
death. Suppose we return to the pictures in the Green Room.
There is nothing very remarkable here, except the portrait of an
artist by himself, which looks for all the world as if it fed upon its
own white lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—Do like the figure of a woman in one corner in the
<cite>Massacre of the Innocents</cite>? The artist has done all he could to
propitiate the English taste. He has left his work in a sufficiently
barbarous and unfinished state.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—But he has taken pains to throw expression, originality,
and breadth into it. With us it would be considered as a work of
genius. I prefer it much to any thing by our artists of the same
kind, both for the tone, the wild lofty character, and the unctuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>freedom of the pencilling. There is a strange hurly-burly in the
background, and a lurid tone over the whole picture. This is what
we mean by imagination—giving the feeling that there is in nature.
You mean by imagination the giving something <em>out of</em> it—such as the
<cite>Nymph</cite> (No. —) <em>appearing to the River God</em>. The young lady is
a very charming transparency, or gauze-drawing; and the River God
is a sturdy wooden statue, painted over; but I would ask you, is
there any thing in the picture that takes you beyond a milliner’s shop
in the Palais-royal, or a tea-garden in the neighbourhood of St.
Cloud? The subject of <cite>Locusta poisoning a young slave</cite>, by Figalon,
is, I think, forcibly and well treated. The old sorceress is not an
every day person. The French too seldom resort to the grace of
Deformity. Yet how finely it tells! They are more timid and
fastidious than the ancients, whom they profess to imitate. There
is one other large historical composition in the room which I am
partial to; and yet the faces, the manners, the colouring, every thing
in it is French. It is the <cite>Henry the Fourth pardoning the peasants
who have supplied the besieged in Paris with food</cite>. That head of a
young woman near the middle is particularly fine, and in the happiest
style of French art. Its effect against the sky is picturesque; it
is handsome, graceful, sensitive, and tinged with an agreeable
florid hue.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—But what is your opinion of Horace Vernet’s Battle-piece?</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—May I ask the subject?</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—It is the battle of Mont-Mirail, after the return from
Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Good: I was sadly afraid it was the Battle of Mont
St. Jean. <em>We</em> ought to blot it forever from our history, if we have
been, or intend to be, free. But I did not know but some Frenchman
might be found to stain his canvass with it, and present it to M. le
Vicomte Chateaubriand.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—But I speak of the painting, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—It is something in the same style, but hardly so clever
as the picture of the Queen’s Trial, by Hayter. Did you see that
when you were in London?</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—No, Sir.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—Then we cannot enter into the comparison.</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—That is true.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—We never had a school of painting till the present day.
Whether we have one at present, will be seen in the course of the
winter. Yours flourished one hundred and fifty years ago. For,
not to include Nicholas Poussin and Claude Lorraine in it, (names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that belong to time and nature,) there were Philip Champagne,
Jouvenet, Le Sueur, whose works are surely unequalled by the
present race of artists, in colouring, in conception of the subject, in
the imitation of nature, and in picturesque effect. As a proof of it,
they become their places, and look well in the Louvre. A picture
of David’s would be an eye-sore there. You are familiar with
their works?</p>

<p class='c000'>French.—I have seen those masters, but there is an objection to
passing into that part of the Louvre.</p>

<p class='c000'>English.—The air is, I own, different.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class='c008'>THE LUXEMBOURG GALLERY</p>

<p class='c000'>Racine’s poetry, and Shakspeare’s, however wide apart, do not
absolutely prove that the French and English are a distinct race of
beings, who can never properly understand one another. But the
Luxembourg Gallery, I think, settles this point forever—not in our
favour, for we have nothing (thank God) to oppose to it, but
decidedly against <em>them</em>, as a people incapable of any thing but the
little, the affected, and extravagant in works of imagination and
the <span class='sc'>Fine Arts</span>. Poetry is but the language of feeling, and we may
convey the same meaning in a different form of words. But in the
language of painting, words become <em>things</em>; and we cannot be mistaken
in the character of a nation, that, in thus expressing themselves,
uniformly leave out certain elements of feeling, and greedily and
ostentatiously insert others that they should not. The English have
properly no school of art, (though they have one painter at least equal
to Molière,)—we have here either done nothing worth speaking of,
compared with our progress in other things, or our faults are those of
negligence and rusticity. But the French have done their utmost
to attain perfection, and they boast of having attained it. What they
have done is, therefore, a fair specimen of what they can do. Their
works contain undoubted proofs of labour, learning, power; yet they
are only the worse for all these, since, without a thorough knowledge
of the scientific and mechanical part of their profession, as well as
profound study, they never could have immortalized their want of
taste and genius in the manner they have done. Their pictures at
the Luxembourg are ‘those faultless monsters which the <em>art</em> ne’er
saw’ till now—the ‘hand-writing on the wall,’ which nothing can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>reverse. It has been said, that ‘Vice to be hated needs but to be
seen,’ and the same rule holds good in natural as in moral deformity.
It is a pity that some kind hand does not take an opportunity of
giving to ashes this monument of their glory and their shame, but
that it is important to preserve the proofs of such an anomaly in the
history of the human mind as a generation of artists painting in this
manner, and looking down upon the rest of the world as not even
able to appreciate their paramount superiority in refinement and
elegance. It is true, strangers know not what to make of them.
The ignorant look at them with wonder—the more judicious, with
pain and astonishment at the perversion of talents and industry.
Still, they themselves go on, quoting one another’s works, and
parcelling out the excellences of the several pictures under different
heads—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>pour les coloris</em>, <em>pour le dessein</em>, <em>pour la composition</em>, <em>pour l’expression</em></span>,
as if all the world were of accord on this subject, and Raphael
had never been heard of. It is enough to stagger a nation, as well as
an individual, in their admiration of their own accomplishments, when
they find they have it all to themselves; but the French are blind,
insensible, incorrigible to the least hint of any thing like imperfection
or absurdity. It is this want of self-knowledge, and incapacity to
conceive of any thing beyond a certain conventional circle, that is
the original sin—the incurable error of all their works of imagination.
If Nature were a French courtezan or Opera-dancer, their poetry
and painting would be the finest in the world.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The fault, then, that I should find with this Collection of Pictures
is, that it is equally defective in the imitation of nature, which belongs
to painting in general; or in giving the soul of nature-expression,
which belongs more particularly to history-painting. Their style of
art is false from beginning to end, nor is it redeemed even by the
vices of genius, originality, and splendour of appearance. It is at
once tame and extravagant, laboured and without effect, repulsive to
the senses and cold to the heart. Nor can it well be otherwise. It
sets out on a wrong principle, and the farther it goes, nay, the more
completely it succeeds in what it undertakes, the more inanimate,
abortive, and unsatisfactory must be the performance. French painting,
in a word, is not to be considered as an independent art, or
original language, coming immediately from nature, and appealing to
it—it is a bad <em>translation</em> of sculpture into a language essentially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>incompatible with it. The French artists take plaster-casts from
the antique, and colour them by a receipt; they take plaster-casts and
put them into action, and give expression to the features according to
the traditional rules for composition and expression. This is the
invariable process: we see the infallible results, which differ only
according to the patience, the boldness, and ingenuity of the painter
in departing from nature, and caricaturing his subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>For instance, let us take the <cite>Endymion</cite> of Girodet, No 57. It is
a well-drawn, though somewhat effeminate Academy-figure. All
the rest is what I have said. It is a waste of labour, an abuse of
power. There is no repose in the attitude; but the body, instead
of being dissolved in an immortal sleep, seems half lifted up, so as to
produce a balance of form, and to make a display of the symmetry
of the proportions. Vanity here presides even over sleep. The head
is turned on one side as if it had not belonged to the body (which it
probably did not) and discovers a meagre, insignificant profile, hard
and pinched up, without any of the genial glow of youth, or the calm,
delighted expansion of the heavenly dream that hovered so long over
it. The sharp edges of the features, like rims of tin, catch the moonlight,
but do not reflect the benign aspect of the Goddess! There is
no feeling (not a particle) of the poetry of the subject. Then the
colouring is not natural, is not beautiful, is not delicate, but that of a
livid body, glittering in the moon-beams, or with a cloud of steel-filings,
glimmering round it for a veil of light. It is not left as <em>dead-colouring</em>
in an evidently unfinished state, or so as to make a blank for
the imagination to fill up (as we see in Fuseli’s pictures); but every
part is worked up with malicious industry, not to represent flesh, but
to be as like marble or polished steel as possible. There is no variety
of tint, no reflected light, no massing, but merely the difference that
is produced in a smooth and uniformly coloured surface, by the alterations
proper to sculpture, which are given with a painful and oppressive
sense of effort and of difficulty overcome.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is not a natural style. It is foppish and mechanical; or just
what might be expected from taking a piece of stone and attempting
to colour it, not from nature, not from imagination or feeling, but
from a mere wilful determination to supply the impressions of one
sense from those of another, by dint of perseverance and a growing
conceit of one’s-self. There is, indeed, a progress to perfection;
for by the time the work is finished, it is a finished piece of arrogance
and folly. If you are copying a yellow colour, and you resolve to
make it blue, the more blue you make it, the more perfectly you
succeed in your purpose; but it is the less like yellow. So the
more perfectly French a work of art is, the less it is like nature!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>The French artists have imitated the presumption of the tyrant
Mezentius, who wished to link dead bodies to living ones.—Again,
in the same artist’s picture of <cite>Atala at the Tomb</cite> (which I think his
best, and which would make a fine bas-relief<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a>) the outline of the
countenance of Atala is really noble, with a beautiful expression of
calm resignation; and the only fault to be found with it is, that,
supported as the head is in the arms of the Priest, it has too much
the look of a bust after the antique, that we see carried about the
streets by the Italian plaster-cast-makers. Otherwise, it is a classical
and felicitous stroke of French genius. They do well to paint Sleep,
Death, Night, or to approach as near as they can to the verge of
<em>still-life</em>, and leaden-eyed obscurity! But what, I believe, is regarded
as the master-piece of this artist, and what I have no objection to
consider as the triumph of French sublimity and pathos, is his picture
of the <cite>Deluge</cite>, No. 55. The national talent has here broken loose
from the trammels of refinement and pedantry, and soars unconstrained
to its native regions of extravagance and bombast. The English are
willing to abide by this as a test. If there be in the whole of this
gigantic picture of a gigantic subject any thing but distortion, meanness,
extreme absurdity and brute force, we are altogether mistaken
in our notions of the matter. Was it not enough to place that huge,
unsightly skeleton of old age upon the shoulders of the son, who is
climbing a tottering, overhanging precipice, but the farce of imposture
and improbability must be systematically kept up by having the wife
clinging to him in all the agony of the most preposterous theatrical
affectation, and then the two children dangling to her like the <em>fag-end</em>
of horror, and completing the chain of disgusting, because impracticable
and monstrous distress? <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod sic mihi ostendis, incredulus odi.</span></i>
The principle of gravitation must be at an end, to make this picture
endurable for a moment. All the effect depends on the fear of
falling, and yet the figures could not remain suspended where they
are for a single instant (but must be flung ‘with hideous ruin and
combustion down,’) if they were any thing else but grisly phantoms.
The terror is at once physical and preternatural. Instead of death-like
stillness or desperate fortitude, preparing for inevitable fate, or
hurrying from it with panic-fear at some uncertain opening, they have
set themselves in a picturesque situation, to meet it under every
disadvantage, playing off their antics like a family of tumblers at
a fair, and exhibiting the horrid grimaces, the vulgar rage, cowardice,
and impatience of the most wretched actors on a stage. The painter
has, no doubt, ‘accumulated horror on horror’s head,’ in straining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the credulity or harrowing up the feelings of the spectator to the
utmost, and proving his want of conception no less by the exaggeration,
than his want of invention by the monotony of his design. Real
strength knows where to stop, because it is founded on truth and
nature; but extravagance and affectation have no bounds. They
rush into the vacuum of thought and feeling, and commit every sort
of outrage and excess.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Neither in the landscape is there a more
historic conception than in the actors on the scene. There is none
of the keeping or unity that so remarkably characterizes Poussin’s
fine picture of the same subject, nor the sense of sullen, gradually
coming fate. The waters do not rise slowly and heavily to the tops
of the highest peaks, but dash tumultuously and violently down rocks
and precipices. This is not the truth of the history, but it accords
with the genius of the composition. I should think the painter
might have received some hints from M. Chateaubriand for the
conduct of it. It is in his frothy, fantastic, rhodomontade way—‘It
out-herods Herod!’</p>

<p class='c000'>David’s pictures, after this, are tame and trite in the comparison;
they are not romantic or <em>revolutionary</em>, but they are completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>French; they are in a little, finical manner, without beauty, grandeur,
or effect. He has precision of outline and accuracy of costume;
but how small a part is this of high history! In a scene like that
of the <cite>Oath of the Horatii</cite>, or the <cite>Pass of Thermopylæ</cite>, who would
think of remarking the turn of an ancle, or the disposition of a piece
of drapery, or the ornaments of a shield? Yet one is quite at leisure
to do this in looking at the pictures, without having one’s thoughts
called off by other and nobler interests. The attempts at expression
are meagre and constrained, and the attitudes affected and theatrical.
There is, however, a unity of design and an interlacing of shields
and limbs, which seems to express one soul in <em>the Horatii</em>, to which
considerable praise would be due, if they had more the look of
heroes, and less that of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitres</span></i>. I do not wonder David does
not like Rubens, for he has none of the Fleming’s bold, sweeping
outline. He finishes the details very prettily and skilfully, but has
no idea of giving magnitude or motion to the whole. His stern
Romans and fierce Sabines look like young gentlemen brought up at
a dancing or fencing school, and taking lessons in these several elegant
exercises. What a fellow has he made of Romulus, standing in the
act to strike with all the air of a modern dandy! The women are
in attitudes, and contribute to the eloquence of the scene. Here is a
wife, (as we learn from the Catalogue) there a sister, here a mistress,
there a grandmother with three infants. Thus are the episodes made
out by a genealogical table of the relations of human life! Such is
the nature of French genius and invention, that they can never get
out of leading-strings! The figure of Brutus, in the picture of that
subject, has a fine, manly, unaffected character. It has shrunk on
one side to brood over its act, without any strut or philosophic
ostentation, which was much to be dreaded. He is wrapt in gloomy
thought, as in a mantle. Mr. Kean might have sat for this figure,
for, in truth, it is every way like him. The group of women on
the opposite side of the canvass, making a contrast by their lively
colours and flimsy expression of grief, might have been spared.
These pictures have, as we were told, been objected to for their
too great display of the naked figure, in some instances bordering
on indecency. The indecency (if so it is) is not in the nakedness
of the figures, but in the barrenness of the artist’s resources to clothe
them with other attributes, and with genius as with a garment. If
their souls had been laid bare as well as their limbs, their spirits
would have shone through and concealed any outward deformity.
Nobody complains of Michael Angelo’s figures as wanting severity
and decorum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Guerin’s <cite>Phædra and Hippolitus</cite> I have already treated of, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>I see no reason to alter my opinion. It was just painted when I last
saw it, and has lost some of its freshness and the gloss of novelty.
Modern pictures have the art of very soon becoming old. What
remains of it has the merit of very clever studies after the antique,
arranged into a subject. The rest is not worth speaking of. A set
of school-boys might as well come with their portfolios and chalk-drawings
under their arms, and set up for a school of Fine Art.
A great nation ought to know better, and either strike out something
original <em>for others to imitate</em>, or acknowledge that they have done
nothing worthy of themselves. To arch an eye-brow, or to point
a finger, is not to paint history. The study of nature can alone form
the genuine artist. Any thing but this can only produce counterfeits.
The tones and colours that feed the eye with beauty, the effects of
light and shade, the soul speaking in the eyes or gasping on the lips,
the groups that varying passion blends, these are the means by which
nature reveals herself to the inspired gaze of genius, and that,
treasured up and stamped by labour and study on the canvass, are
the indispensable materials of historical composition. To take
plaster-casts and add colour to them by an act of the will; or to
take the same brittle, inanimate, inflexible models, and put life and
motion into them by mechanical and learned rules, is more than
Prometheus or Iris could pretend to do. It is too much for French
genius to achieve. To put a statue into motion, or to give appropriate,
natural, and powerful expression to set features of any kind, is at all
times difficult; but, in the present instance, the difficulty is enhanced,
till it amounts to a sort of contradiction in terms; for it is proposed
to engraft French character and expression (the only ones with which
the artists are acquainted, or to which they can have access as living
studies) on Greek forms and features. Two things more abhorrent
in nature exist not. One of two consequences necessarily happens:
either the original model is given literally and entire, without any
attempt to disguise the awkward plagiarism, and inform it with a new
character; or if the artist, disdaining such servile trammels, strives
to infuse his own conceptions of grace and grandeur into it, then the
hero or God of antiquity comes down from his pedestal to strut a
French dancing-master or tragedian. For simplicity and unexampled
grace, we have impertinence and affectation; for stoic gravity and
majestic suffering, we have impatience, rage, womanish hysterics,
and the utmost violence of frenzied distortion. French art (like all
other national art) is either nothing, or a transcript of the national
character. In the <cite>Æneas and Dido</cite>, of the same artist, the drawing,
the costume, the ornaments, are correct and classical; the toilette of
the picture is well made; the Æneas is not much more insipid than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the hero of Virgil, and there is an exceedingly pretty girl, (like a
common French peasant girl,) a supposed attendant on the Queen.
The only part of the picture in which he has attempted an extraordinary
effect, and in which he has totally failed, is in the expression
of enamoured attention on the part of the Queen. Her eyes do
not, ‘like stars, shoot madly from their spheres,’ but they seem to
have no sort of business in her head, and make the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doucereuse</span></i> in a
most edifying manner. You are attracted to the face at a distance
by the beauty of the outline (which is Greek) and instantly repelled
by the grossness of the filling up of the expression (which is French).
The Clytemnestra is, I think, his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i>. She is a noble figure,
beautiful in person, and deadly of purpose; and there is that kind of
breathless suppression of feeling, and noiseless moving on to her end,
which the rigid style of French art is not ill-adapted to convey.
But there is a strange tone of colouring thrown over the picture,
which gives it the appearance of figures done in stained porcelain, or
of an optical deception. There is nothing to remind you that the
actors of the scene are of flesh and blood. They may be of steel
or bronze, or glazed earthenware, or any other smooth, unfeeling
substance. This hard, <em>liny</em>, metallic, tangible character is one of the
great discriminating features of French painting, which arises partly
from their habitual mode of study, partly from the want of an eye
for nature, but chiefly, I think, from their craving after precise and
definite ideas, in which, if there is the least flaw or inflection, their
formal apprehension loses sight of them altogether, and cannot recover
the clue. This incrusted, impenetrable, stifling appearance is not
only unpleasant to the eye, but repels sympathy, and renders their
pictures (what they have been asserted to be) <em>negations</em> equally of the
essential qualities both of painting and sculpture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of their want of <em>ideal</em> passion, or of the poetry of painting, and
tendency to turn every thing either into comic or tragic pantomime,
the picture of <cite>Cain after the Murder of Abel</cite>, by Paul Guerin, is a
striking example. This composition does not want power. It would
be disingenuous to say so. The artist has done what he meant in it.
What, then, has he expressed? The rage of a wild beast, or of a
maniac gnashing his teeth, and rushing headlong down a precipice to
give vent to a momentary frenzy; not the fixed inward anguish of a
man, withered by the curse of his Maker, and driven out into the
wide universe with despair and solitude and unavailing remorse for
his portion. The face of his wife, who appears crouched behind
him, possesses great beauty and sweetness. But the sweetness and
beauty are kept quite distinct. That is, grief absorbs some of the
features, while others retain all their softness and serenity. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>hypercriticism would not have been possible, if the painter had studied
the expression of grief in nature. But he took a plaster-model, and
tried to melt it into becoming woe!</p>

<p class='c000'>I have said enough to explain my objections to the grand style of
French art; and I am sure I do not wish to pursue so unpleasant a
subject any farther. I only wish to hint to my countrymen some
excuse for not admiring these pictures, and to satisfy their neighbours
that our want of enthusiasm is not wholly owing to barbarism and
blindness to merit. It may be asked then, ‘Is there nothing to praise
in this collection?’ Far from it. There are many things excellent
and admirable, with the drawbacks already stated, and some others
that are free from them. There is Le Thiere’s picture of the
<cite>Judgment of Brutus</cite>; a manly, solid, and powerful composition,
which was exhibited some years ago in London, and is, I think,
decidedly superior to any of our West’s. In Horace Vernet’s
<cite>Massacre of the Mamelukes</cite>, no English critic will deny the expression
of gloomy ferocity in the countenance of the Sultan, or refuse to
extol the painting of the drapery of the Negro, with his back to the
spectator, which is, perhaps, equal to any thing of the Venetian
School, and done (for a wager) from real drapery. Is not ‘the
human face divine’ as well worth studying in the original as the dyes
and texture of a tunic? A small picture, by Delacroix, taken from
the Inferno, <cite>Virgil and Dante in the boat</cite>, is truly picturesque in the
composition and the effect, and shews a real eye for Rubens and for
nature. The forms project, the colours are thrown into masses.
Gerard’s <cite>Cupid and Psyche</cite> is a beautiful little picture, and is indeed
as beautiful, both in composition and expression, as any thing of the
kind can well be imagined; I mean, that it is done in its essential
principles as a design <em>from</em> or <em>for</em> sculpture. The productions of the
French school make better prints than pictures. Yet the best of
them look like engravings from antique groups or cameos.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a> There
is also a set of small pictures by Ducis, explaining the effects of Love
on the study of Painting, Sculpture, and Poetry, taken from appropriate
subjects, and elegantly executed. Here French art appears in
its natural character again, courtly and polished, and is proportionably
attractive. Perhaps it had better lay aside the club of Hercules, and
take up the distaff of Omphale; and then the women might fairly
beat the men out of the field, as they threaten almost to do at present.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The French excel in pieces of light gallantry and domestic humour,
as the English do in interiors and pig-styes. This appears to me the
comparative merit and real bias of the two nations, in what relates to
the productions of the pencil; but both will scorn the compliment,
and one of them may write over the doors of their Academies of
Art—‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnis excidit ausis</span></i>.’ The other cannot even say so much.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class='c008'>NATIONAL ANTIPATHIES</p>

<p class='c000'>The prejudice we entertain against foreigners is not in the first
instance owing to any ill-will we bear them, so much as to the
untractableness of the imagination, which cannot admit two standards
of moral value according to circumstances, but is puzzled by the
diversity of manners and character it observes, and made uneasy in its
estimate of the propriety and excellence of its own. It seems that
others ought to conform to our way of thinking, or we to theirs;
and as neither party is inclined to give up their peculiarities, we cut
the knot by hating those who remind us of them. We get rid of
any idle, half-formed, teazing, irksome sense of obligation to sympathise
with or meet foreigners half way, by making the breach as
wide as possible, and treating them as an inferior species of beings to
ourselves. We become enemies, because we cannot be friends. Our
self-love is annoyed by whatever creates a suspicion of our being in
the wrong; and only recovers its level by setting down all those who
differ from us as thoroughly odious and contemptible.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is this consideration which makes the good qualities of other
nations, in which they excel us, no set-off to their bad ones, in which
they fall short of us; nay, we can forgive the last much sooner than
the first. The French being a dirty people is a complaint we very
often bring against them. This objection alone, however, would
give us very little disturbance; we might make a wry face, an
exclamation, and laugh it off. But when we find that they are lively,
agreeable, and good-humoured in spite of their dirt, we then know
not what to make of it. We are angry at seeing them enjoy themselves
in circumstances in which we should feel so uncomfortable;
we are baulked of the advantage we had promised ourselves over
them, and make up for the disappointment by despising them heartily,
as a people callous and insensible to every thing like common decency.
In reading Captain Parry’s account of the Esquimaux Indian woman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>who so dexterously trimmed his lamp by licking up half the train-oil,
and smearing her face and fingers all over with the grease, we barely
smile at this trait of barbarism. It does not provoke a serious
thought; for it does not stagger us in our opinion of ourselves. But
should a fine Parisian lady do the same thing (or something like it)
in the midst of an eloquent harangue on the infinite superiority of the
French in delicacy and refinement, we should hardly restrain our
astonishment at the mixture of incorrigible grossness and vanity.
Unable to answer her arguments, we should begin to hate her person:
her gaiety and wit, which had probably delighted us before, would
be changed into forwardness, flippancy, and impertinence; from seeing
it united with so many accomplishments, we should be led to doubt
whether <em>sluttishness</em> was not a virtue, and should remove the doubt
out of court by indulging a feeling of private resentment, and resorting
to some epithet of national abuse. The mind wishes to pass an act
of uniformity for all its judgments: in defiance of every day’s experience,
it will have things of a piece, and where it cannot have every
thing right or its own way, is determined to have it all wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Frenchman, we will say, drops what we think a frivolous
remark, which excites in us some slight degree of impatience:
presently after, he makes a shrewd, sensible observation. This rather
aggravates the mischief, than mends it; for it throws us out in our
calculations, and confounds the distinction between <em>sense</em> and <em>nonsense</em>
in our minds. A volley of unmeaning declamation or frothy impertinence
causes us less chagrin than a single word that overturns some
assertion we had made, or puts us under the necessity of reversing, or
imposes on us the still more unwelcome task of revising our conclusions.
It is easy in this case to save ourselves the trouble by
calling our antagonist <em>knave</em> or <em>fool</em>; and the temptation is too strong,
when we have a whole host of national prejudices at our back to
justify us in so concise and satisfactory a mode of reasoning. A
greater fund of vivacity and agreeable qualities in our neighbours is
not sure to excite simple gratitude or admiration; it much oftener
excites envy, and we are uneasy till we have quieted the sense of our
deficiency by construing the liveliness of temper or invention, with
which we cannot keep pace, into an excess of levity, and the continued
flow of animal spirits into a species of intoxication or insanity.
Because the French are animated and full of gesticulation, they are a
<em>theatrical</em> people; if they smile and are polite, they are <em>like monkeys</em>—an
idea an Englishman never has out of his head, and it is well if he
can keep it between his lips.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> No one assuredly would appear dull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and awkward, who can help it. Many an English <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belle</span></i>, who figures
at home in the first circles of fashion and is admired for her airy,
thoughtless volubility, is struck dumb, and looks a mere <em>dowdy</em> (as if
it were a voluntary or assumed transformation of character) the
moment she sets foot on French ground; and the whispered sounds,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lourde</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">elle n’est pas spirituelle</span></i>, lingering in her ears, will not induce
her to dissuade her husband (if he is a Lord or Member of Parliament)
from voting for a French war, and are answered by the
thunders of our cannon on the French coast! We even quarrel
with the beauty of French women, because it is not English. If
their features are regular, we find fault with their complexions; and
as to their expression, we grow tired of that eternal smile upon their
faces; though their teeth are white, why should they be always
shewing them? Their eyes have an unpleasant glitter about them;
and their eye-brows, which are frequently black and arched, are
painted and put on! In short, no individual, no nation is liked by
another for the advantages it possesses over it in wit or wisdom, in
happiness or virtue. We despise others for their inferiority, we hate
them for their superiority; and I see no likelihood of an accommodation
at this rate. The English go abroad; and when they
come back, they brood over the civilities or the insults they have
received with equal discontent. The gaiety of the Continent has
thrown an additional damp upon their native air, and they wish to
clear it by setting fire to a foreign town or blowing up a foreign
citadel. We are then easy and comfortable for a while. We think
we can do something, that is, violence and wrong; and should others
talk of retaliating, we say with Lord Bathurst, ‘Let them come!—our
fingers tingling for the fray, and finding that nothing rouses us
from our habitual stupor like hard blows. Defeated in the arts of
peace, we get in good humour with ourselves by trying those of war.
Ashamed to accost a lady, we dare face a bastion—without spirit to
hold up our heads, we are too obstinate to turn our backs—and give
ourselves credit for being the greatest nation in the world, because
our Jack Tars (who defend the wooden walls of Old England—the
same that we afterwards see with sore arms and wooden legs, begging
and bawling about our streets) are the greatest <em>blackguards</em> on the
face of the globe; because our Life Guardsmen, who have no brains
to lose, are willing to have them knocked out, and because with the
incessant noise and stir of our steam-engines and spinning-jennies (for
having no wish to enjoy, we are glad to work ourselves to death) we
can afford to pay all costs!</p>

<p class='c000'>What makes the matter worse, is the idle way in which we <em>abstract</em>
upon one another’s characters. We are struck only with the differences,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and leave the common qualities out of the question. This
renders a mutual understanding hopeless. We put the exceptions for
the rule. If we meet with any thing odd and absurd in France, it is
immediately set down as French and characteristic of the country,
though we meet with a thousand odd and disagreeable things every
day in England (that we never met before) without taking any
notice of them. There is a wonderful <em>keeping</em> in our prejudices; we
reason as consistently as absurdly upon the confined notions we have
taken up. We put the good, wholesome, hearty, respectable qualities
into one heap and call it English, and the bad, unwholesome, frivolous,
and contemptible ones into another heap, and call it French; and
whatever does not answer to this pretended sample, we reject as
spurious and partial evidence. Our coxcomb conceit stands over the
different races of mankind, like a smart serjeant of a regiment, and
drills them into a pitiful uniformity, we ourselves being picked out as
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite du corps</span></i>, and the rest of the world forming the forlorn hope
of humanity. One would suppose, to judge from the conversation of
the two nations, that all Frenchmen were alike, and that all Englishmen
were personified by a particular individual, nicknamed John Bull.
The French have no idea that there is any thing in England but
roast-beef and plum-pudding, and a number of round, red faces,
growing fat and stupid upon such kind of fare; while our traditional
notion of the French is that of <em>soup-maigre</em> and wooden shoes, and a
set of scare-crow figures corresponding to them. All classes of
society and differences of character are by this unfair process consolidated
into a sturdy, surly English yeoman on the one side of the
Channel, or are boiled down and evaporate into a shivering, chattering
valet-de-chambre, or miserable half-starved peasant on the other. It
is a pleasant way of settling accounts and taking what we please for
granted. It is a very old method of philosophizing, and one that is
quite likely to last!</p>

<p class='c000'>If we see a little old hump-backed withered Frenchman about five
feet high, tottering on before us on a pair of spindle-shanks, with
white thread stockings, a shabby great-coat, and his hair done up into
a queue, his face dry, grey, and pinched up, his cheeks without blood
in them, his eyes without lustre, and his body twisted like a corkscrew,
we point to this grotesque figure as a true Frenchman, as the
very essence of a Parisian, and an edifying vestige of the ancient
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i> and of the last age, before the French character was sophisticated.
It does not signify that just before we had passed a bluff,
red-faced, jolly-looking coachman or countryman, six feet four inches
high, having limbs in proportion, and able to eat up any two ordinary
Englishmen. This thumping make-weight is thrown out of the scale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>because it does not help out our argument, or confirm our prejudices.
This huge, raw-boned, heavy, knock-kneed, well-fed, shining-faced
churl makes no impression on our minds, because he is not French,
according to our idea of the word; or we pass him over under the
pretext that he <em>ought</em> to be an Englishman. But the other extreme
we seize upon with avidity and delight; we dandle it, we doat upon
it, we make a puppet of it to the imagination; we speak of it with
glee, we quote it as a text, we try to make a caricature of it; our
pens itch to describe it as a complete specimen of the French nation,
and as a convincing and satisfactory proof, that the English are the
only people who are of sound mind and body, strong wind and limb,
and free from the infirmities of a puny constitution, affectation, and
old age! An old woman in France, with wrinkles and a high-plaited
cap, strikes us as being quite French, as if the old women in
England did not wear night-caps, and were not wrinkled. In passing
along the streets, or through the walks near Paris, we continually
meet a gentleman and lady whom we take for English, and they turn
out to be French; or we fancy that they are French, and we find on
a nearer approach, or from hearing them speak, that they are English.
This does not at all satisfy us that there is no such marked difference
between the two nations as we are led to expect; but we fasten on
the first <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lusus naturæ</span></i> we can find out as a striking representative of
the universal French nation, and chuckle over and almost hug him to
our bosoms as having kindly come to the relief of our wavering prejudices,
and as an undoubted proof of our superiority to such a set of
abortions as this, and of our right to insult and lord it over them at
pleasure! If an object of this kind (as it sometimes happens) asks
charity with an air of briskness and <em>politesse</em>, and does not seem quite
so wretched as we would have him, this is a further confirmation of
our theory of the national conceit and self-sufficiency; and his cheerfulness
and content under deformity and poverty are added to his
catalogue of crimes!<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> We have a very old and ridiculous fancy in
England, that all Frenchmen are or ought to be lean, and their
women short and crooked; and when we see a great, fat, greasy
Frenchman waddling along and ready to burst with good living, we
get off by saying that it is an unwholesome kind of fat; or, if a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Frenchwoman happens to be tall and straight, we immediately take
a disgust at her masculine looks, and ask if all the women in France
are giantesses?</p>

<p class='c000'>It is strange we cannot let other people alone who concern themselves
so little about us. Why measure them by our standard? Can
we allow nothing to exist for which we cannot account, or to be right
which has not our previous sanction? The difficulty seems to be
to suspend our judgments, or to suppose a variety of causes to produce
a variety of effects. All men must be alike—all Frenchmen must be
alike. This is a portable theory, and suits our indolence well. But,
if they do not happen to come exactly into our terms, we are angry,
and transform them into beasts. Our first error lies in expecting a
number of different things to tally with an abstract idea, or general
denomination, and we next stigmatize every deviation from this
standard by a nickname. A Spaniard, who has more gravity than
an Englishman, is an owl; a Frenchman, who has less, is a monkey.
I confess, this last simile sticks a good deal in my throat; and at
times it requires a stretch of philosophy to keep it from rising to my
lips. A walk on the Boulevards is not calculated to rid an Englishman
of all his prejudices or of all his spleen. The resemblance to an
English <em>promenade</em> afterwards makes the difference more mortifying.
There is room to breathe, a footpath on each side of the road, and trees
over your head. But presently the appearance of a Bartlemy-fair all
the year round, the number of little shabby stalls, the old iron, pastry,
and children’s toys; the little white lapdogs, with red eyes, combing
and washing; the mud and the green trees, wafting alternate odours;
the old women sitting like <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra cotta</span></i> figures; the passengers running
up against you, (most of them so taken up with themselves that they
seem like a crowd of absent people!) the noise, the bustle, the flutter,
the hurry without visible object; the vivacity without intelligible
meaning; the loud and incessant cry of ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs</span></i>’ from a bawling
charlatan inviting you to some paltry, cheating game, and a broad
stare or insignificant grin from the most ill-bred and ill-looking of the
motley set at the appearance of an Englishman among them; all this
jumble of little teazing, fantastical, disagreeable, chaotic sensations
really puts one’s patience a little to the test, and throws one a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>off one’s guard. I was in this humour the other day, and wanted
some object to conduct off a superfluity of rising irritability, when, at
a painted booth opposite, I saw a great lubberly boy in an ecstacy of
satisfaction. He had on a red coat, a huge wig of coarse yellow
hair, and with his hat was beating a monkey in the face, dressed <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
militaire</span></i>—grinning, jabbering, laughing, screaming, frantic with delight
at the piteous aspect and peevish gestures of the animal; while a tall
showman, in a rusty blue coat and long pig-tail, (which might have
been stolen from the monkey) looked on with severe complacency
and a lofty pride in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bizarrerie</span></i>, and the ‘mutually reflected
charities’ of the scene. The trio (I am vexed to think it) massed
themselves in my imagination, and I was not sorry to look upon them
as a little national group, well-matched, and tricked out alike in
pretensions to humanity.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I was relieved from this fit of misanthropy, by getting into the
shade of the barrier-wall, and by meeting a man, (a common French
mechanic,) carrying a child in his arms, and the mother by its side,
clapping her hands at it, smiling, and calling out ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon petit ami!</span>’
with unmingled and unwearied delight. There was the same over-animation
in talking to the child as there would have been in talking
to a dog or a parrot. But here it gave pleasure instead of pain,
because our sympathies went along with it. I change my opinion of
the French character fifty times a day, because, at every step, I wish
to form a theory, which at the next step, is contradicted. The
ground seems to me so uncertain—the tenure by which I hold my
opinions so frail, that at last I grow ashamed of them altogether—of
what I think right, as of what I think wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>To praise or to blame is perhaps equally an impertinence. While
we are strangers to foreign manners and customs, we cannot be judges;
it would take almost a life to understand the reasons and the differences;
and by the time we can be supposed to do this, we become
used to them, and in some sense parties concerned. The English
are the fools of an hypothesis, as the Scotch are of a system. We
must have an opinion—right or wrong; but, in that case, till we have
the means of knowing whether it is right or wrong, it is as well to
have a qualified one. We may at least keep our temper, and collect
hints for self-correction; we may amuse ourselves in collecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>materials for a decision that may never be passed, or will have little
effect, even when it is, and may clear our eyesight from the motes
and beams of prejudice by looking at things as they occur. Our
opinions have no great influence on others; but the spirit in which
we form them has a considerable one on our own happiness. It is of
more importance to ourselves than to the French, what we think of
them. It would be hard if a mental obliquity on their parts should
‘thrust us from a level consideration,’ or some hasty offence taken at
the outset should shut up our eyes, our ears, and understandings for
the rest of a journey, that we have commenced for no other purpose
than to be spectators of a new and shifting scene, and to have our
faculties alike open to impressions of all sorts.</p>

<p class='c000'>What Englishman has not seen the <em>Cemetery of Père la Chaise</em>?
What Englishman will undertake either to condemn or entirely
approve it, unless he could enter completely into the minds of the
French themselves? The approach to it (a little way out of Paris)
is literally ‘garlanded with flowers.’ You imagine yourself in the
neighbourhood of a wedding, a fair, or some holiday-festival. Women
are sitting by the road-side or at their own doors, making chaplets of
a sort of yellow flowers, which are gathered in the fields, baked, and
will then last a French ‘Forever.’ They have taken ‘the lean
abhorred monster,’ Death, and strewed him o’er and o’er with
sweets; they have made the grave a garden, a flower-bed, where all
Paris reposes, the rich and the poor, the mean and the mighty, gay
and laughing, and putting on a fair outside as in their lifetime. Death
here seems life’s playfellow, and grief and smiling content sit at one
tomb together. Roses grow out of the clayey ground; there is the
urn for tears, the slender cross for faith to twine round; the neat
marble monument, the painted wreaths thrown upon it to freshen
memory, and mark the hand of friendship. ‘No black and melancholic
yew-trees’ darken the scene, and add a studied gloom to it—no
ugly death’s heads or carved skeletons shock the sight. On
the contrary, some pretty Ophelia, as general mourner, appears to
have been playing her fancies over a nation’s bier, to have been
scattering ‘pansies for thoughts, rue for remembrances.’ But is not
the expression of grief, like hers, a little too fantastical and light-headed?
Is it not too much like a childish game of <em>Make-Believe</em>?
Or does it not imply a certain want of strength of mind, as well as
depth of feeling, thus to tamper with the extremity of woe, and
varnish over the most serious contemplation of mortality? True
sorrow is manly and decent, not effeminate or theatrical. The tomb
is not a baby-house for the imagination to hang its idle ornaments and
mimic finery in. To meet sad thoughts, and overpower or allay them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>by other lofty and tender ones, is right; but to shun them altogether,
to affect mirth in the midst of sighing, and divert the pangs of inward
misfortune by something to catch the eye and tickle the sense, is what
the English do not sympathize with. It is an advantage the French
have over us. The fresh plants and trees that wave over our graves;
the cold marble that contains our ashes; the secluded scene that
collects the wandering thoughts; the innocent, natural flowers that
spring up, unconscious of our loss—objects like these at once
cherish and soften our regrets; but the petty daily offerings of condolence,
the forced liveliness and the painted pride of the scene before
us, are like galvanic attempts to recall the fleeting life—they neither
flatter the dead nor become the living! One of the most heartless
and flimsy extravagances of the <em>New Eloise</em>, is the attempt made to
dress up the daughter of Madame d’Orbe like Julia, and set her in
her place at the table after her death. Is not the burying-ground of
the <em>Père la Chaise</em> tricked out and over-acted much on the same
false principle, as if there were nothing sacred from impertinence and
affectation? I will not pretend to determine; but to an English
taste it is so. We see things too much, perhaps, on the dark side;
they see them too much (if that is possible) on the bright. Here is
the tomb of Abelard and Eloise—immortal monument, immortal as
the human heart and poet’s verse can make it! But it is slight,
fantastic, of the olden time, and seems to shrink from the glare of
daylight, or as if it would like to totter back to the old walls of the
Paraclete, and bury its quaint devices and its hallowed inscriptions in
shadowy twilight. It is, however, an affecting sight, and many a
votive garland is sprinkled over it. Here is the tomb of Ney, (the
double traitor) worthy of his fate and of his executioner;—and of
Massena and Kellerman. There are many others of great note,
and some of the greatest names—Molière, Fontaine, De Lille.
Chancellors and <em>charbottiers</em> lie mixed together, and announce themselves
with equal pomp. These people have as good an opinion of
themselves after death as before it. You see a bust with a wreath
or crown round its head—a strange piece of masquerade—and other
tombs with a print or miniature of the deceased hanging to them!
Frequently a plain marble slab is laid down for the surviving relatives
of the deceased, waiting its prey in expressive silence. This is
making too free with death, and acknowledging a claim which
requires no kind of light to be thrown upon it. We should visit the
tombs of our friends with more soothing feelings, without marking
out our own places beside them. But every French thought or
sentiment must have an external emblem. The inscriptions are in
general, however, simple and appropriate. I only remarked one to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>which any exception could be taken; it was a plain tribute of
affection to some individual by his family, who professed to have
‘erected this <em>modest</em> monument to preserve his memory <em>forever</em>!’
What a singular idea of modesty and eternity! So the French, in
the Catalogue of the Louvre, in 1803, after recounting the various
transmigrations of the Apollo Belvidere in the last two thousand years
(vain warnings of mutability!) observed, that it was at last placed in
the Museum at Paris, ‘to remain there forever.’ Alas! it has been
gone these ten years.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mademoiselle Mars (of whom so much has been said) quite comes
up to my idea of an accomplished comic actress. I do not know
that she does more than this, or imparts a feeling of excellence that
we never had before, and are at a loss how to account for afterwards
(as was the case with our Mrs. Jordan and Mrs. Siddons in opposite
departments,) but she answers exactly to a preconception in the mind,
and leaves nothing wanting to our wishes. I had seen nothing of the
kind on our stage for many years, and my satisfaction was the greater,
as I had often longed to see it. The last English actress who shone
in genteel comedy was Miss Farren, and she was just leaving the
stage when I first became acquainted with it. She was said to be
a faint copy of Mrs. Abington—but I seem to see her yet, glittering
in the verge of the horizon, fluttering, gay, and airy, the ‘elegant turn
of her head,’ the nodding plume of feathers, the gloves and fan, the
careless mien, the provoking indifference—we have had nothing like
it since, for I cannot admit that Miss O’Neil had the <em>Lady-Teazle</em> air
at all. Out of tragedy she was awkward and heavy. She could
draw out a white, patient, pathetic pocket-handkerchief with great
grace and simplicity; she had no notion of flirting a fan. The rule
here is to do every thing without effort—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Flavia the least and slightest toy</div>
      <div class='line'>Can with resistless art employ.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This art is lost among us; the French still have it in very considerable
perfection. Really, it is a fine thing to see Molière’s <cite>Misanthrope</cite>,
at the Theatre Français, with Mademoiselle Mars as <em>Celimène</em>. I
had already seen some very tolerable acting at the minor French
Theatres, but I remained sceptical; I still had my English scruples
hanging about me, nor could I get quite reconciled to the French
manner. For <em>mannerism</em> is not excellence. It might be good, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>was not sure of it. Whatever one hesitates about in this way, is not
the best. If a thing is first-rate, you see it at once, or the fault is
yours. True genius will always get the better of our local prejudices,
for it has already surmounted its own. For this reason, one becomes
an immediate convert to the excellence of the French school of
serious comedy. Their actors have lost little or nothing of their
spirit, <em>tact</em>, or skill in embodying the wit and sense of their favourite
authors. The most successful passages do not interfere with our
admiration of the best samples of English acting, or run counter to
our notions of propriety. That which we thought well done among
ourselves, we here see as well or better done; that which we
thought defective, avoided. The excellence or even superiority of
the French over us only confirms the justness of our taste. If the
actor might feel some jealousy, the critic can feel none. What
Englishman does not read Molière with pleasure? Is it not a
treat then to see him well acted? There is nothing to recall our
national antipathies, and we are glad to part with such unpleasant
guests.</p>

<p class='c000'>The curtain is scarcely drawn up, when something of this effect
is produced in the play I have mentioned, and the entrance of
Mademoiselle Mars decides it. Her few first simple sentences—her
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Ami</span></i>’ at her lover’s first ridiculous suggestion, the mingled
surprise, displeasure, and tenderness in the tone—her little peering
eyes, full of languor and archness of meaning—the peaked nose and
thin compressed lips, opening into an intelligent, cordial smile—her
self-possession—her slightest gesture—the ease and rapidity of her
utterance, every word of which is perfectly distinct—the playful,
wondering good-nature with which she humours the Misanthrope’s
eccentricities throughout, and the finer tone of sense and feeling in
which she rejects his final proposal, must stamp her a favourite with
the English as well as with the French part of the audience. I
cannot see why that should not be the case. She is all life and spirit.
Would we be thought entirely without them? She has a thorough
understanding and relish of her author’s text. So, we think, have
we. She has character, expression, decision—they are the very
things we pique ourselves upon. Ease, grace, propriety—we aspire
to them, if we have them not. She is free from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">simagrées</span></i>,
the unmeaning petulance and petty affectation that we reproach the
French with, and has none of the awkwardness, insipidity, or vulgarity
that we are so ready to quarrel with at home. It would be strange
if the English did not admire her as much as they profess to do. I
have seen but one book of travels in which she was abused, and that
was written by a Scotchman! Mademoiselle Mars is neither handsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>nor delicately formed. She has not the light airy grace, nor
the evanescent fragility of appearance that distinguished Miss Farren,
but more point and meaning, or more of the intellectual part of
comedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was admirably supported in <em>Celimène</em>. Monsieur Damas
played the hero of the <cite>Misanthrope</cite>, and played it with a force and
natural freedom which I had no conception of as belonging to the
French stage. If they drawl out their tragic rhymes into an endless
sing-song, they cut up their comic verses into <em>mincemeat</em>. The pauses,
the emphasis, are left quite <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i>, and are as sudden and varied
as in the most familiar or passionate conversation. In Racine they
are obliged to make an effort to get out of themselves, and are solemn
and well-behaved; in Molière they are at home, and commit all sorts
of extravagances with wonderful alacrity and effect. Heroes in
comedy, pedants in tragedy, they are greatest on small occasions;
and their most brilliant efforts arise out of the ground of common life.
Monsieur Damas’s personification of the Misanthrope appeared to me
masterly. He had apparently been chosen to fill the part for his
ugliness; but he played the lover and the fanatic with remarkable
skill, nature, good-breeding, and disordered passion. The rapidity,
the vehemence of his utterance and gestures, the transitions from one
feeling to another, the fond rapture, the despair, the rage, the sarcastic
coolness, the dignified contempt, were much in the style of our most
violent tragic representations, and such as we do not see in our serious
comedy or in French tragedy. The way in which this philosophic
madman gave a loose to the expression of his feelings, when he first
suspects the fidelity of his mistress, when he quarrels with her, and
when he is reconciled to her, was strikingly affecting. It was a
regular furious scolding-bout, with the ordinary accompaniments of
tears, screams, and hysterics. A comic actor with us would have
made the part insipid and genteel; a tragic one with them pompous
and affected. At Drury-lane, Mr. Powell would take the part.
Our fine gentlemen are walking suits of clothes; their tragic performers
are a professor’s gown and wig: the Misanthrope of Molière,
as Monsieur Damas plays it, is a true orator and man of genius. If
they pour the oil of decorum over the loftier waves of tragedy, their
sentimental comedy is like a puddle in a storm. The whole was
admirably cast, and ought to make the English ashamed of themselves,
if they are not above attending to any thing that can give
pleasure to themselves or other people. Arsinoe, the friend and rival
of Celimène, was played by Madame ——, a ripe, full-blown beauty,
a prude, the redundancies of whose person and passions are kept in
due bounds by tight lacing and lessons of morality. Eliante was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Mademoiselle Menjaud, a very amiable-looking young person, and
exactly fitted to be an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élève</span></i> in this <cite>School for Scandal</cite>. She smiled
and blushed and lisped mischief in the prettiest manner imaginable.
The man who comes to read his Sonnet to Alceste was inimitable.
His teeth had an enamel, his lips a vermilion, his eyes a brilliancy, his
smile a self-complacency, such as never met in poet or in peer, since
Revolutions and Reviews came into fashion. He seemed to have
been preserved in a glass-case for the last hundred and fifty years, and
to have walked out of it in these degenerate days, dressed in brocade,
in smiles and self-conceit, to give the world assurance of what a
Frenchman was! Philinte was also one of those prosing confidants,
with grim features, and profound gravity, that are to be found in all
French plays, and who, by their patient attention to a speech of half
an hour long, acquire an undoubted right to make one of equal length
in return. When they were all drawn up in battle-array, in the scene
near the beginning, which Sheridan has copied, it presented a very
formidable aspect indeed, and the effect was an historical deception.
You forgot you were sitting at a play at all, and fancied yourself
transported to the court or age of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span>!—Blest period!—the
triumph of folly and of France, when, instead of poring over systems
of philosophy, the world lived in a round of impertinence—when to
talk nonsense was wit, to listen to it politeness—when men thought
of nothing but themselves, and turned their heads with dress instead
of the affairs of Europe—when the smile of greatness was felicity,
the smile of beauty Elysium—and when men drank the brimming
nectar of self-applause, instead of waiting for the opinion of the
<em>reading public</em>! Who would not fling himself back to this period of
idle enchantment? But as we cannot, the best substitute for it is to
see a comedy of Molière’s acted at the Theatre Français. The
thing is there imitated to the life.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, there is something sufficiently absurd and improbable in
this play. The character from which it takes its title is not well
made out. A misanthrope and a philanthropist are the same thing,
as Rousseau has so well shewn in his admirable criticism on this piece.
Besides, what can be so nationally characteristic as the voluntary or
dramatic transfers of passion in it? Alceste suspects his mistress’s
truth, and makes an abrupt and violent declaration of love to another
woman in consequence, as if the passion (in French) went along with
the speech, and our feelings could take any direction at pleasure
which we bethought ourselves of giving them. And then again,
when after a number of outrages and blunders committed by himself,
he finds he is in the wrong, and that he ought to be satisfied with
<em>Celimène</em> and the world, which turns out no worse than he always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>thought it; he takes, in pure spite and the spirit of contradiction, the
resolution to quit her forever, unless she will agree to go and live
with him in a wilderness. This is not misanthropy, but sheer
‘midsummer madness.’ It is a mere idle abstract determination to
be miserable, and to make others so, and not the desperate resource
of bitter disappointment (for he has received none) nor is it in the
least warranted by the proud indignation of a worthy sensible man at
the follies of the world (which character Alceste is at first represented
to be). It is a gratuitous start of French imagination, which is still
in extremes, and ever in the wrong. Why, I would ask, must a man
be either a mere courtier and man of the world, pliant to every
custom, or a mere enthusiast and maniac, absolved from common
sense and reason? Why could not the hero of the piece be a
philosopher, a satirist, a railer at mankind in general, and yet marry
<em>Celimène</em>, with whom he is in love, and who has proved herself
worthy of his regard? The extravagance of <em>Timon</em> is tame and
reasonable to this, for <em>Timon</em> had been ruined by his faith in mankind,
whom he shuns. Yet the French would consider <em>Timon</em> as a very
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">farouche</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">outré</span></i> sort of personage. To be hurried into extremities
by extreme suffering and wrong, is with them absurd and shocking:
to play the fool without a motive or in virtue of making a set speech,
they think in character and keeping. So far, to be sure, we differ in
the first principles of dramatic composition. A similar remark might
be made on the Tartuffe. This character is detected over and over
again in acts of the most barefaced profligacy and imposture; he
makes a fine speech on the occasion, and <em>Orgon</em> very quietly puts the
offence in his pocket. This credulity to verbal professions would be
tolerated on no stage but the French, as natural or probable. Plain
English practical good sense would revolt at it as a monstrous fiction.
But the French are so fond of hearing themselves talk, that they take
a sort of interest (by proxy) in whatever affords an opportunity for
an ingenious and prolix harangue, and attend to the dialogue of their
plays, as they might to the long-winded intricacies of a law-suit. Mr.
Bartolino Saddletree would have <em>assisted</em> admirably at a genuine
prosing French Comedy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mademoiselle Mars played also in the afterpiece, a sort of shadowy
<cite>Catherine and Petruchio</cite>. She is less at home in the romp than in the
fine lady. She did not give herself up to the ‘whole loosened soul’
of farce, nor was there the rich laugh, the sullen caprice, the childish
delight and astonishment in the part, that Mrs. Jordan would have
thrown into it. Mrs. Orger would have done it almost as well.
There was a dryness and restraint, as if there was a constant dread of
running into caricature. The outline was correct, but the filling up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>was not bold or luxuriant. There is a tendency in the lighter French
comedy to a certain <em>jejuneness</em> of manner, such as we see in lithographic
prints. They do not give full swing to the march of the
humour, just as in their short, tripping walk they seem to have their
legs tied. Madame Marsan is in this respect superior. There was
an old man and woman in the same piece, in whom the quaint
drollery of a couple of veteran retainers in the service of a French
family was capitally expressed. The humour of Shakspeare’s play,
as far as it was extracted, hit very well.—The behaviour of the
audience was throughout exemplary. There was no crowd at the
door, though the house was as full as it could hold; and indeed most
of the places are bespoke, whenever any of their standard pieces are
performed. The attention never flags; and the buzz of eager
expectation and call for silence, when the curtain draws up, is just
the same as with us when an Opera is about to be performed, or a
song to be sung. A French audience are like flies caught in treacle.
Their wings are clogged, and it is all over with their friskings and
vagaries. Their bodies and their minds <em>set</em> at once. They have, in
fact, a national theatre and a national literature, which we have not.
Even well-informed people among us hardly know the difference
between Otway and Shakspeare; and if a person has a fancy for any
of our elder classics, he may have it to himself for what the public
cares. The French, on the contrary, know and value their best
authors. They have Molière and Racine by heart—they come to
their plays as to an intellectual treat; and their beauties are reflected
in a thousand minds around you, as you see your face at every turn in
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Café des Milles-Colonnes</span></i>. A great author or actor is really in
France what one fancies them in England, before one knows any
thing of the world as it is called. It is a pity we should set ourselves
up as the only reading or reflecting people—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut lucus a non lucendo</span></i>.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a>
But we have here no oranges in the pit, no cry of porter and cider,
no jack-tars to <em>encore</em> Mr. Braham three times in ‘The Death of
Abercrombie,’ and no play-bills. This last is a great inconvenience
to strangers, and is what one would not expect from a play-going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>people; though it probably arises from that very circumstance, as
they are too well acquainted with the actors and pieces to need a
prompter. They are not accidental spectators, but constant visitors,
and may be considered as behind the scenes.</p>

<p class='c000'>I saw three very clever comic actors at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Theatre des Variétés</span>
on the Boulevards, all quite different from each other, but quite
French. One was <em>Le Peintre</em>, who acted a master-printer; and he
<em>was</em> a master-printer, so bare, so dingy, and so wan, that he might be
supposed to have lived on printer’s ink and on a crust of dry bread
cut with an <em>oniony</em> knife. The resemblance to familiar life was so
complete and so habitual, as to take away the sense of imitation or
the pleasure of the deception. Another was Odry, (I believe,) who
with his blue coat, gold-laced hat, and corpulent belly, resembled a
jolly, swaggering, good-humoured parish-officer, or the boatswain of
an English man-of-war. His <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclats de rire</span></i>, the giddy way in which he
ran about the stage (like an overgrown school-boy), his extravagant
noises, and his gabbling and face-making were, however, quite in the
French style. A fat, pursy Englishman, acting the <em>droll</em> in this
manner, would be thought drunk or mad; the Frenchman was only
gay! Monsieur Potier played an old lover, and, till he was <em>drest</em>,
looked like an old French cook-shop keeper. The old beau transpired
through his finery afterwards. But, though the part was
admirably understood, the ridicule was carried too far. This person
was too meagre, his whisper too inaudible, his attempts at gallantry
too feeble and vapid, and the whole too much an exhibition of mere
physical decay to make the satire pleasant. There should be at least
some revival of the dead; the taper of love ought to throw out an
expiring gleam. In the song in praise of Love he threw a certain
romantic air into the words, warbling them in a faint <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">demi-voix</span></i>, and
with the last sigh of a youthful enthusiasm fluttering on his lips.
This was charming. I could not help taking notice, that during his
breakfast, and while he is sipping his coffee, he never once ceases
talking to his valet the whole time. The concluding scene, in which,
after kneeling to his mistress, he is unable to rise again without the
help of his nephew, who surprises him in this situation, and who is
also his rival, is very amusing.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The songs at this theatre are very
pleasing and light, but so short, that they are over almost as soon as
begun, and before your ears have a <em>mouthful</em> of sound. This is very
tantalizing to us; but the French seem impatient to have the dialogue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>go on again, in which they may suppose themselves to have a share.
I wanted to see Brunet, but did not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Talma and Mademoiselle Georges (the great props of French
tragedy) are not at present here. Talma is at Lyons, and Mademoiselle
Georges has retired <em>on a pique</em> into the country, in the
manner of some English actresses. I had seen them both formerly,
and should have liked to see them again. Talma has little of the
formal <em>automaton</em> style in his acting. He has indeed that common
fault in his countrymen of speaking as if he had swallowed a handful
of snuff; but in spite of this, there is great emphasis and energy in
his enunciation, a just conception, and an impressive representation of
character. He comes more in contact with nature than our Kemble-school,
with more of dignity than the antagonist one. There is a
dumb eloquence in his gestures. In <cite>Œdipus</cite>, I remember his raising
his hands above his head, as if some appalling weight were falling on
him to crush him; and in the <cite>Philoctetes</cite>, the expression of excruciating
pain was of that mixed mental and physical kind, which is so
irresistibly affecting in reading the original Greek play, which Racine
has paraphrased very finely. The sounds of his despair and the
complaints of his desolate situation were so thrilling, that you might
almost fancy you heard the wild waves moan an answer to them.
Mademoiselle Georges (who gave recitations in London in 1817)
was, at the time I saw her, a very remarkable person. She was
exceedingly beautiful, and exceedingly fat. Her fine handsome
features had the regularity of an antique statue, with the roundness
and softness of infancy. Her well-proportioned arms (swelled out
into the largest dimensions) tapered down to a delicate baby-hand.
With such a disadvantage there was no want of grace or flexibility in
her movements. Her voice had also great sweetness and compass.
It either sunk into the softest accents of tremulous plaintiveness, or
rose in thunder. The effect was surprising; and one was not
altogether reconciled to it at first. She plays at the Odeon, and has
a rival at the Theatre Français, Madame Paradol, who is very like
her in person. She is an immense woman; when I saw her, I
thought it was Mademoiselle Georges fallen away! There are some
other tragic actresses here, with the prim airs of a French milliner
forty years ago, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hardiesse</span></i> of a battered <em>gouvernante</em>, and the brazen
lungs of a drum-major. Mademoiselle Duchesnois I have not had
an opportunity of seeing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Paris is a beast of a city to be in—to those who cannot get out of it.
Rousseau said well, that all the time he was in it, he was only trying
how he should leave it. It would still bear Rabelais’ double etymology
of <cite>Par-ris</cite> and <cite>Lutetia</cite>.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> There is not a place in it where you
can set your foot in peace or comfort, unless you can take refuge in
one of their hotels, where you are locked up as in an old-fashioned
citadel, without any of the dignity of romance. Stir out of it, and
you are in danger of being run over every instant. Either you must
be looking behind you the whole time, so as to be in perpetual fear of
their hackney-coaches and cabriolets; or, if you summon resolution,
and put off the evil to the last moment, they come up against you
with a sudden acceleration of pace and a thundering noise, that
dislocates your nervous system, till you are brought to yourself by
having the same startling process repeated. Fancy yourself in
London with the footpath taken away, so that you are forced to
walk along the middle of the streets with a dirty gutter running
through them, fighting your way through coaches, waggons, and handcarts
trundled along by large mastiff-dogs, with the houses twice as
high, greasy holes for shop-windows, and piles of wood, green-stalls,
and wheelbarrows placed at the doors, and the contents of wash-hand
basins pouring out of a dozen stories—fancy all this and worse, and,
with a change of scene, you are in Paris. The continual panic in
which the passenger is kept, the alarm and the escape from it, the
anger and the laughter at it, must have an effect on the Parisian
character, and tend to make it the whiffling, skittish, snappish,
volatile, inconsequential, unmeaning thing it is. The coachmen
nearly drive over you in the streets, because they would not mind
being driven over themselves—that is, they would have no fear of it
the moment before, and would forget it the moment after. If an
Englishman turns round, is angry, and complains, he is laughed at as
a blockhead; and you must submit to be rode over in your national
character. A horseman makes his horse curvet and capriole right
before you, because he has no notion how an English lady, who is
passing, can be nervous. They run up against you in the street out
of mere heedlessness and hurry, and when you expect to have a
quarrel (as would be the case in England) make you a low bow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>slip on one side, to shew their politeness. The very walk of the
Parisians, that light, jerking, fidgetting trip on which they pride
themselves, and think it grace and spirit, is the effect of the awkward
construction of their streets, or of the round, flat, slippery stones, over
which you are obliged to make your way on tiptoe, as over a succession
of stepping-stones, and where natural ease and steadiness are out
of the question. On the same principle, French women shew their
legs (it is a pity, for they are often handsome, and a stolen glimpse of
them would sometimes be charming) sooner than get draggle-tailed;
and you see an old French beau generally walk like a crab nearly
sideways, from having been so often stuck up in a lateral position
between a coach-wheel, that threatened the wholeness of his bones,
and a stone-wall that might endanger the cleanliness of his person.
In winter, you are splashed all over with the mud; in summer, you
are knocked down with the smells. If you pass along the middle of
the street, you are hurried out of breath; if on one side, you must
pick your way no less cautiously. Paris is a vast pile of tall and
dirty alleys, of slaughter-houses and barbers’ shops—an immense
suburb huddled together within the walls so close, that you cannot
see the loftiness of the buildings for the narrowness of the streets, and
where all that is fit to live in, and best worth looking at, is turned out
upon the quays, the boulevards, and their immediate vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paris, where you can get a sight of it, is really fine. The view
from the bridges is even more imposing and picturesque than ours,
though the bridges themselves and the river are not to compare with
the Thames, or with the bridges that cross it. The mass of public
buildings and houses, as seen from the Pont Neuf, rises around you on
either hand, whether you look up or down the river, in huge, aspiring,
tortuous ridges, and produces a solidity of impression and a fantastic
confusion not easy to reconcile. The clearness of the air, the glittering
sunshine, and the cool shadows add to the enchantment of the
scene. In a bright day, it dazzles the eye like a steel mirror. The
view of London is more open and extensive; it lies lower, and
stretches out in a lengthened line of dusky magnificence. After all,
it is an ordinary town, a place of trade and business. Paris is a
splendid vision, a fabric dug out of the earth, and hanging over it.
The stately, old-fashioned shapes and jutting angles of the houses
give it the venerable appearance of antiquity, while their texture and
colour clothe it in a robe of modern splendour. It looks like a collection
of palaces, or of ruins! They have, however, no single
building that towers above and crowns the whole, like St. Paul’s,
(the Pantheon is a stiff, <em>unjointed</em> mass to it)—nor is <em>Notre-Dame</em> at
all to be compared to Westminster-Abbey with its Poets’ Corner, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>urn full of noble English ashes, where Lord Byron was ashamed to
lie. The Chamber of Deputies (formerly the residence of the Dukes
of Bourbon) presents a brilliant frontispiece, but it is a kind of
architectural abstraction, standing apart, and unconnected with every
thing else, not burrowing, like our House of Commons (that true and
original model of a Representative Assembly House!) almost underground,
and lost among the <em>rabble</em> of streets. The Tuileries is also a
very noble pile of buildings, if not a superb piece of architecture. It
is a little heavy and monotonous, a habitation for the bodies or for
the minds of Kings, but it goes on in a laudable jog-trot, right-lined
repetition of itself, without much worth or sense in any single part (like
the accumulation of greatness in an hereditary dynasty). At least it
ought to be finished (for the omen’s sake), to make the concatenation
of ideas inviolable and complete! The Luxembourg, the Hospital
of Invalids, the Hall of Justice, and innumerable other buildings,
whether public or private, are far superior to any of the kind we have
in London, except Whitehall, on which Inigo Jones laid his graceful
hands; or Newgate, where we English shine equally in architecture,
morals, and legislation. Our palaces (within the bills of mortality)
are dog-holes, or receptacles for superannuated Abigails, and tabbies
of either species. Windsor (whose airy heights are placed beyond
them) is, indeed, a palace for a king to inhabit, or a poet to describe,
or to turn the head of a prose-writer. (See Gray’s Ode, and the
famous passage in Burke about it.) Buonaparte’s Pillar, in the Place
Vendôme, cast in bronze, and with excellent sculptures, made of the
cannon taken from the Allies in their long march to Paris, is a fine
copy of the antique. A white flag flaps over it. I should like to
write these lines at the bottom of it. Probably, Mr. Jerdan will
know where to find them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The new streets and squares in this neighbourhood are also on an
improved plan—there is a double side-path to walk on, the shops are
more roomy and richer, and you can stop to look at them in safety.
This is as it should be—all we ask is common sense. Without this
practical concession on their parts, in the dispute whether Paris is not
better than London, it would seem to remain a question, whether it is
better to walk on a mall or in a gutter, whether airy space is preferable
to fetid confinement, or whether solidity and show together are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>better than mere frippery? But for a real West End, for a solid
substantial <em>cut</em> into the heart of a metropolis, commend me to the
streets and squares on each side of the top of Oxford-street—with
Grosvenor and Portman squares at one end, and Cavendish and
Hanover at the other, linked together by Bruton, South-Audley, and
a hundred other fine old streets, with a broad airy pavement, a display
of comfort, of wealth, of taste, and rank all about you, each house
seeming to have been the residence of some respectable old English
family for half a century past, and with Portland-place looking out
towards Hampstead and Highgate, with their hanging gardens and
lofty terraces, and Primrose-hill nestling beneath them, in green,
pastoral luxury, the delight of the Cockney, the aversion of Sir
Walter and his merry-men! My favourite walk in Paris is to the
Gardens of the Tuileries. Paris differs from London in this respect,
that it has no suburbs. The moment you are beyond the barriers, you
are in the country to all intents and purposes. You have not to wade
through ten miles of straggling houses to get a breath of fresh air, or a
peep at nature. It is a blessing to counterbalance the inconveniences
of large cities built within walls, that they do not extend far beyond
them. The superfluous population is pared off, like the pie-crust by
the circumference of the dish—even on the court side, not a hundred
yards from the barrier of Neuilly, you see an old shepherd tending
his flock, with his dog and his crook and sheep-skin cloak, just as if it
were a hundred miles off, or a hundred years ago. It was so twenty
years ago. I went again to see if it was the same yesterday. The old
man was gone; but there was his flock by the road-side, and a dog
and a boy, grinning with white healthy teeth, like one of Murillo’s
beggar-boys. It was a bright frosty noon; and the air was, in a
manner, <em>vitreous</em>, from its clearness, its coolness, and hardness to the
feeling. The road I speak of, frequented by English jockeys and
French market-women, riding between panniers, leads down to the
Bois de Boulogne on the left, a delicious retreat, covered with copse-wood
for fuel, and intersected by greensward paths and shady alleys,
running for miles in opposite directions, and terminating in a point of
inconceivable brightness. Some of the woods on the borders of
Wiltshire and Hampshire present exactly the same appearance, with
the same delightful sylvan paths through them, and are covered in
summer with hyacinths and primroses, sweetening the air, enamelling
the ground, and with nightingales loading every bough with rich
music. It was winter when I used to wander through the Bois de
Boulogne formerly, dreaming of fabled truth and good. Somehow
my thoughts and feet still take their old direction, though hailed by
no friendly greetings:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>yet the fever and the agony of hope is over too, ‘the burden and the
mystery;’ the past circles my head, like a golden dream; it is a
fine fragment of an unfinished poem or history; and the ‘worst,’ as
Shakspeare says, ‘returns to good!’ I cannot say I am at all
annoyed (as I expected) at seeing the Bourbon court-carriages issuing
out with a flourish of trumpets and a troop of horse. It looks like a
fantoccini procession, a State mockery. The fine moral lesson, the
soul of greatness, is wanting. The legitimate possessors of royal
power seem to be playing at <em>Make-Believe</em>; the upstarts and impostors
are the true <em>Simon Pures</em> and genuine realities. Bonaparte mounted
a throne from the top of the pillar of Victory. People ask who
Charles <span class='fss'>X.</span> is? But to return from this digression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the arch-way of the Tuileries, at the end of the Champs
Elysées, you see the Barrier of Neuilly, like a thing of air, diminished
by a fairy perspective. The effect is exquisitely light and magical.
You pass through the arch-way, and are in the gardens themselves.

<p class='c000'>True art is ‘nature to advantage drest;’ it is here a powdered beau.
The prodigality of littleness, the excess of ornament, the superficial
gloss, the studied neatness, are carried to a pitch of the romantic.
The Luxembourg gardens are more extensive, and command a finer
view; but are not kept in the same order, are dilapidated and
desultory. This is an enclosure of all sweet sights and smells, a
concentration of elegance. The rest of the world is barbarous to
this ‘paradise of dainty devices,’ where the imagination is spell-bound.
It is a perfectly-finished miniature set in brilliants. It is a toilette for
nature to dress itself; where every flower seems a narcissus! The
smooth gravel-walks, the basin of water, the swans (they might be of
wax), the golden fishes, the beds of flowers, chine-asters, larkspur,
geraniums, bright marigolds, mignonette (‘the Frenchman’s darling’)
scenting the air with a faint luscious perfume, the rows of orange-trees
in boxes, blooming verdure and vegetable gold, the gleaming
statues, the raised terraces, the stately avenues of trees, and the gray
cumbrous towers of the Tuileries overlooking the whole, give an
effect of enchantment to the scene. This and the man in black by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Titian, in the Louvre just by (whose features form a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sombre</span></i> pendant
to the gay parterres) are the two things in Paris I like best. I
should never tire of walking in the one, or of looking at the other.
Yet no two things can be more opposite.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a> The one is the essence of
French, the other of Italian art. By following the windings of the
river in this direction, you come to Passy—a delightful village, half-way
to St. Cloud, which is situated on a rich eminence that looks
down on Paris and the Seine, and so on to Versailles, where the
English reside. I have not been to see them, nor they me. The
whole road is interspersed with villas, and lined with rows of trees.
This last is a common feature in foreign scenery. Whether from the
general love of pleasurable sensations, or from the greater warmth of
southern climates making the shelter from the heat of the sun more
necessary, or from the closeness of the cities making a promenade
round them more desirable, the approach to almost all the principal
towns abroad is indicated by shady plantations, and the neighbourhood
is a succession of groves and arbours.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champ de Mars</span> (the French Runnymede) is on the opposite
side of the river, a little above the Champs Elysées. It is an oblong
square piece of ground immediately in front of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">École Militaire</span>,
covered with sand and gravel, and bare of trees or any other ornament.
It is left a blank, as it should be. In going to and returning from it,
you pass the fine old Invalid Hospital, with its immense gilded
cupola and outer-walls overgrown with vines, and meet the crippled
veterans who have lost an arm or leg, fighting the battles of the
Revolution, with a bit of white ribbon sticking in their button-holes,
which must gnaw into their souls worse than the wounds in their
flesh, if Frenchmen did not alike disregard the wounds both of their
bodies and minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jardin des Plantes, situated at the other extremity of Paris,
on the same side of the river, is well worth the walk there. It is
delightfully laid out, with that mixture of art and nature, of the
useful and ornamental, in which the French excel all the world.
Every plant of every quarter of the globe is here, growing in the
open air; and labelled with its common and its scientific name on it.
A prodigious number of animals, wild and tame, are enclosed in
separate divisions, feeding on the grass or shrubs, and leading a life
of learned leisure. At least, they have as good a title to this ironical
compliment as most members of colleges and seminaries of learning;
for they grow fat and sleek on it. They have a great variety of the
<em>simious</em> tribe. Is this necessary in France? The collection of wild
beasts is not equal to our Exeter-‘Change; nor are they confined in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>iron cages out of doors under the shade of their native trees (as I was
told), but shut up in a range of very neatly-constructed and very
ill-aired apartments.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already mentioned the Père la Chaise—the Catacombs I
have not seen, nor have I the least wish. But I have been to the top
of Mont-Martre, and intend to visit it again. The air there is truly
vivifying, and the view inspiring. Paris spreads out under your feet
on one side, ‘with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,’ and
appears to fill the intermediate space, to the very edge of the horizon,
with a sea of hazy or sparkling magnificence. All the different
striking points are marked as on a map. London nowhere presents
the same extent or integrity of appearance. This is either because
there is no place so near to London that looks down upon it from the
same elevation, or because Paris is better calculated for a panoramic
view from the loftier height and azure tone of its buildings. Its
form also approaches nearer to a regular square. London, seen
either from Highgate and Hampstead, or from the Dulwich side,
looks like a long black wreath of smoke, with the dome of St. Paul’s
floating in it. The view on the other side Mont-Martre is also fine,
and an extraordinary contrast to the Paris side—it is clear, brown,
flat, distant, completely rustic, full of ‘low farms and pelting villages.’
You see St. Denis, where the Kings of France lie buried, and can
fancy you see Montmorenci, where Rousseau lived, whose pen was
near being as fatal to their race as the scythe of death. On this
picturesque site, which so near London would be enriched with noble
mansions, there are only a few paltry lodging-houses and tottering
windmills. So little prone are the Parisians to extricate themselves
from the sty of Epicurus; so fond of <em>cabinets of society</em>, of playing at
dominoes in the coffee-houses, and of practising the art <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de briller dans
les Salons</span></i>; so fond are they of this, that even when the Allies were
at Mont-Martre, they ran back to be the first to give an imposing
account of the attack, to finish the game of the Revolution, and make
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éloge</span></i> of the new order of things. They shew you the place
where the affair with the Prussians happened, as—a brilliant exploit.
When will they be no longer liable to such intrusions as these, or to
such a result from them? When they get rid of that eternal smile
upon their countenances, or of that needle-and-thread face, that is
twisted into any shape by every circumstance that happens,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> or when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>they can write such lines as the following, or even understand their
meaning, their force or beauty, as a charm to purge their soil of
insolent foes—theirs only, because the common foes of man!</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>No Parisian’s sides can ‘bear the beating of so strong a passion,’ as
these lines contain; nor have they it in them to ‘endure to the end
for liberty’s sake.’ They can never hope to defend the political
principles which they learnt from us, till they understand our poetry,
both of which originate in the same cause, the strength of our livers
and the stoutness of our hearts.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class='c008'>Statuary does not affect me like painting. I am not, I allow, a
fair judge, having paid a great deal more attention to the one than to
the other. Nor did I ever think of the first as a profession; and it
is that perhaps which adds the sting to our love of excellence, the
hope of attaining it ourselves in any particular walk. We strain our
faculties to the utmost to conceive of what is most exquisite in any
art to which we devote ourselves, and are doubly sensitive to it when
we see it attained. Knowledge may often beget indifference, but
here it begets zeal. Our affections kindled and projected forward by
the ardour of pursuit, we come to the contemplation of truth and
beauty with the passionate feeling of lovers; the examples of
acknowledged excellence before us are the steps by which we scale
the path of distinction, the spur which urges us on; and the admiration
which we fondly cherish for them is the seed of future fame.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>No wonder that the youthful student dwells with delight and rapture
on the finished works of art, when they are to his heated fancy the
pledge and foretaste of immortality; when at every successful stroke
of imitation he is ready to cry out with Correggio—‘I also am a
painter!’—when every heightening flush of his enthusiasm is a fresh
assurance to him of congenial powers—and when overlooking the
million of failures (that all the world have forgot) or names of inferior
note, Raphael, Titian, Guido, Salvator are each another self. Happy
union of thoughts and destinies, lovelier than the hues of the rainbow!
Why can it not last and span our brief date of life?</p>

<p class='c000'>One reason, however, why I prefer painting to sculpture is, that
painting is more like nature. It gives one entire and satisfactory
view of an object at a particular moment of time, which sculpture
never does. It is not the same in reality, I grant; but it is the same
in appearance, which is all we are concerned with. A picture wants
solidity, a statue wants colour. But we see the want of colour as a
palpably glaring defect, and we do not see the want of solidity, the
effects of which to the spectator are supplied by light and shadow.
A picture is as perfect an imitation of nature as is conveyed by a
looking-glass; which is all that the eye can require, for it is all it can
take in for the time being. A fine picture resembles a real living
man; the finest statue in the world can only resemble a man turned
to stone. The one is an image, the other a cold abstraction of
nature. It leaves out half the visible impression. There is therefore
something a little shocking and repulsive in this art to the common
eye, that requires habit and study to reconcile us completely to it, or
to make it an object of enthusiastic devotion. It does not amalgamate
kindly and at once with our previous perceptions and associations.
As to the comparative difficulty or skill implied in the exercise of
each art, I cannot pretend to judge: but I confess it appears to me
that statuary must be the most trying to the faculties. The idea of
moulding a limb into shape, so as to be right from every point of
view, fairly makes my head turn round, and seems to me to enhance
the difficulty to an infinite degree. There is not only the extraordinary
circumspection and precision required (enough to distract
the strongest mind, as I should think), but if the chisel, working in
such untractable materials, goes a hair’s-breadth beyond the mark,
there is no remedying it. It is not as in painting, where you may
make a thousand blots, and try a thousand experiments, efface them
all one after the other, and begin anew: the hand always trembles on
the brink of a precipice, and one step over is irrecoverable. There
is a story told, however, of Hogarth and Roubilliac, which, as far as
it goes, may be thought to warrant a contrary inference. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>artists differed about the difficulty of their several arts, and agreed to
decide it by exchanging the implements of their profession with each
other, and seeing which could do best without any regular preparation.
Hogarth took a piece of clay, and succeeded in moulding a
very tolerable bust of his friend; but when Roubilliac, being furnished
with paints and brushes, attempted to daub a likeness of a human
face, he could make absolutely nothing out, and was obliged to own
himself defeated. Yet Roubilliac was a man of talent, and no mean
artist. It was he who, on returning from Rome where he had
studied the works of Bernini and the antique, and on going to see his
own performances in Westminster Abbey, exclaimed, that ‘they
looked like tobacco-pipes, by G—d! ‘What sin had this man or
his parents committed, that he should forfeit the inalienable birthright
of every Frenchman—imperturbable, invincible self-sufficiency?
The most pleasing and natural application of sculpture is, perhaps, to
the embellishment of churches and the commemoration of the dead.
I don’t know whether they were Roubilliac’s or not, but I remember
seeing many years ago in Westminster Abbey (in the part that is at
present shut up) two figures of angels bending over a tomb, that
affected me much in the same manner that these lines of Lord
Byron’s have done since—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And when I think that his immortal wings</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall one day hover o’er the sepulchre</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the poor child of clay that so adored him</div>
      <div class='line'>As he adores the highest, Death becomes</div>
      <div class='line'>Less terrible!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It appears to me that sculpture, though not proper to express
health or life or motion, accords admirably with the repose of the
tomb; and that it cannot be better employed than in arresting the
fleeting dust in imperishable forms, and in embodying a lifeless
shadow. Painting, on the contrary, from what I have seen of it in
Catholic countries, seems to be out of its place on the walls of
churches; it has a flat and flimsy effect contrasted with the solidity
of the building, and its rich flaunting colours harmonize but ill with
the solemnity and gloom of the surrounding scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>I would go a pilgrimage to see the St. Peter Martyr, or the
Jacob’s Dream by Rembrandt, or Raphael’s Cartoons, or some of
Claude’s landscapes;—but I would not go far out of my way to see
the Apollo, or the Venus, or the Laocoon. I never cared for them
much; nor, till I saw the Elgin Marbles, could I tell why, except
for the reason just given, which does not apply to these particular
statues, but to statuary in general. These are still to be found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, with appropriate descriptive stanzas
appended to them;<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a> but they are no longer to be found in the Louvre,
nor do the French seem to know they ever were there. <em>Out of sight,
out of mind</em>, is a happy motto. What is not French, either as
done by themselves, or as belonging to them, is of course not worth
thinking about. Be this as it may, the place is fairly emptied out.
Hardly a trace remains of the old Collection to remind you of what
is gone. A short list includes all of distinguished excellence—the
admirable bust of Vitellius, the fine fragment of Inopus, a clothed
statue of Augustus, the full-zoned Venus, and the Diana and Fawn,
whose light, airy grace seems to have mocked removal. A few more
are ‘thinly scattered to make up a shew,’ but the bulk, the main
body of the Grecian mythology, with the flower of their warriors
and heroes, were carried off by the Chevalier Canova on his
shoulders, a load for Hercules! The French sculptors have nothing
of their own to shew for it to fill up the gap. Like their painters,
their style is either literal and rigid, or affected and burlesque. Their
merit is chiefly confined to the academic figure and anatomical skill;
if they go beyond this, and wander into the regions of expression,
beauty, or grace, they are apt to lose themselves. The real genius
of French sculpture is to be seen in the curled wigs and swelling
folds of the draperies in the statues of the age of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> There
they shone unrivalled and alone. They are the best man-milliners
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">friseurs</span></i> in ancient or modern Europe. That praise cannot be
denied them; but it should alarm them for their other pretensions.
I recollect an essay in the <cite>Moniteur</cite> some years ago (very playful and
very well written) to prove that a great hair-dresser was a greater
character than Michael Angelo or Phidias; that his art was more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>an invention, more a creation out of nothing, and less a servile copy
of any thing in nature. There was a great deal of ingenuity in the
reasoning, and I suspect more sincerity than the writer was aware of.
It expresses, I verily believe, the firm conviction of every true
Frenchman. In whatever relates to the flutter and caprice of
fashion, where there is no impulse but vanity, no limit but extravagance,
no rule but want of meaning, they are in their element, and
quite at home. Beyond that, they have no style of their own, and
are a nation of second-hand artists, poets, and philosophers. Nevertheless,
they have Voltaire, La Fontaine, Le Sage, Molière,
Rabelais, and Montaigne—good men and true, under whatever class
they come. They have also Very and Vestris. This is granted.
Is it not enough? I should like to know the thing on the face of
God’s earth in which they allow other nations to excel them. Nor
need their sculptors be afraid of turning their talents to account,
while they can execute pieces of devotion for the shrines of Saints,
and classical <em>equivoques</em> for the saloons of the old or new <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foregoing remarks are general. I shall proceed to mention
a few exceptions to, or confirmations of them in their <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Exposé</span></i><a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a> of the
present year. The <cite>Othryadas wounded</cite> (No. 1870), by Legendre
Heral, is, I think, the least <em>mannered</em>, and most natural. It is a
huge figure, powerful and somewhat clumsy (with the calves of the
legs as if they had gaiters on), but it has great power and repose in
it. It seems as if, without any effort, a blow from it would crush
any antagonist, and reminds one of Virgil’s combat of Dares and
Entellus. The form of the head is characteristic, and there is a
fine mixture of sternness and languor in the expression of the features.
The sculptor appears to have had an eye to the countenance of the
Dying Gladiator; and the figure, from its ease and massiness, has
some resemblance to the Elgin Marbles. It is a work of great
merit. The statue of <cite>Othryadas erecting the Trophy to his Companions</cite>
(No. 1774) is less impressive, and aims at being more so. It comes
under the head of <em>theatrical</em> art, that is of French art <em>proper</em>. They
cannot long keep out of this. They cannot resist an attitude, a
significant effect. They do not consider that the definition of
Sculpture is, or ought to be, nearly like their own celebrated one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>of <cite>Death</cite>—an eternal repose! This fault may in some measure be
found with the <cite>Hercules recovering the body of Icarus from the Sea</cite>
(No. 1903), by Razzi. The body of Icarus can hardly be said to
have found a resting-place. Otherwise, the figure is finely designed,
and the face is one of considerable beauty and expression. The
Hercules is a man-mountain. From the size and arrangement of
this group, it seems more like a precipice falling on one’s head, than
a piece of sculpture. The effect is not so far pleasant. If a
complaint lies against this statue on the score of unwieldy and
enormous size, it is relieved by No. 1775, <cite>A Zephyr thwarting the
loves of a Butterfly and a Rose</cite>, Boyer. Here French art is on its
legs again, and in the true vignette style. A Zephyr, a Butterfly,
and a Rose, all in one group—Charming! In such cases the lightness,
the prettiness, the flutter, and the affectation are extreme, and
such as no one but themselves will think of rivalling. One of their
greatest and most successful attempts is the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grâce aux Prisonniers</span></cite>.
No. 1802, by David. Is it not the <cite>Knife-grinder</cite> of the ancients,
thrown into a more heroic attitude, and with an impassioned expression?
However this may be, there is real boldness in the design,
and animation in the countenance, a feeling of disinterested generosity
contending with the agonies of death. I cannot give much praise
to their religious subjects in general. The French of the present
day are not bigots, but sceptics in such matters; and the cold, formal
indifference of their artists appears in their works. The <cite>Christ
confounding the incredulity of St. Thomas</cite> (by Jacquot) is not calculated
to produce this effect on anybody else. They treat classical subjects
much more <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>; but the mixture of the Christian Faith and of
Pagan superstitions is at least as reprehensible in the present Collection
as in Milton’s Paradise Lost. Among pieces of devotion, <cite>The
Virgin and Child</cite>, and the <cite>St. Catherine</cite> of Cortot (Nos. 1791–22)
struck me as the best. There is a certain delicacy of finishing and
graceful womanhood about both, which must make them very
acceptable accompaniments to Catholic zeal. The French excel
generally in emblematic subjects, or in whatever depends on accuracy
and invention in costume, of which there are several examples here.
What I liked best, however, were some of their studies of the naked
figure, which have great simplicity and ease, such as a <cite>Nymph making
a Garland of Flowers</cite>, No. 1888 (Parmentier), and a <cite>Youth going to
bathe</cite>, No. 1831 (Espercieux). This last figure, in particular,
appears to be really sliding down into the bath. <cite>Cupid tormenting the
Soul</cite> (after Chaudet) is a very clever and spirited design, in bronze.
Their busts, in general, are not excellent. There are, however, a
few exceptions, one especially of a Mademoiselle Hersilie de F——,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>by Gayrard, which is a perfect representation of nature. It is an
unaffected, admirable portrait, with good humour and good sense
playing over every feature of the face.</p>

<p class='c000'>In fine, I suspect there is nothing in the French Saloon of Sculpture
greatly to stagger or entirely to overset the opinion of those who
have a prejudice against the higher pretensions of French art. They
have no masterpieces equal to Chantry’s busts, nor to Flaxman’s
learned outlines, nor to the polished elegance of Canova; to say
nothing of the exquisite beauty and symmetry of the antique, nor of
the Elgin Marbles, among which the Theseus sits in form like a
demi-god, basking on a golden cloud. If ever there were models
of the Fine Arts fitted to give an impulse to living genius, these are
they.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> With enough to teach the truest, highest style in art, they
are not in sufficient numbers or preservation to distract or discourage
emulation. With these and Nature for our guides, we might do
something in sculpture, if we were not indolent and unapt. The
French, whatever may be their defects, cannot be charged with want
of labour and study. The only charge against them (a heavy one,
if true) is want of taste and genius.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class='c008'>The French themselves think less about their music than any other
of their pretensions. It is almost a sore subject with them; for it
interrupts their talking, and they had rather hear nothing about it,
except as an accompaniment to a jig. Their ears are, in this respect,
<em>in their heels</em>, and it is only the light and giddy that they at all endure.
They have no idea of <em>cadence</em> in any of the arts—of the rise and fall
of the passions—of the elevations or depressions of hope or fear in
poetry—of alternate light or shade in pictures—all is reduced (as
nearly as possible) in their minds to the level of petty, vapid self-satisfaction,
or to dry and systematic prosing for the benefit of others.
But they must be more particularly at a loss in music, which requires
the deepest feeling, and admits the least of the impertinence of
explanation, which mounts on its own raptures and is dissolved in
its own tenderness; which has no witness or vouchers but the inward
sense of delight, and rests its faith on the speechless eloquence, the
rich, circling intoxication of inarticulate but heart-felt sounds. The
French have therefore no national music, except a few meagre
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons</span></i>, and their only idea of musical excellence is either rapidity
or loudness of execution. You perceive the effect of this want of
enthusiasm even in the streets,—they have neither barrel-organs nor
blind fiddlers as with us, who are willing to pay for the encouragement
of the arts, however indifferently we may practise them; nor
does the national spirit break out from every strolling party or village
group, as it is said to do in Italy. A French servant-girl, while she
is cleaning out a room, lays down her brush to dance—she takes it
up to finish her work, and lays it down again to dance, impelled by
the lightness of her head and of her heels. But you seldom hear her
sing at her work, and never, if there is any one within hearing to talk
to.—The French Opera is a splendid, but a comparatively empty
theatre. It is nearly as large (I should think) as the King’s Theatre
in the Hay-market, and is in a semi-circular form. The pit (the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>evening I was there) was about half full of men, in their black,
dingy <em>sticky-looking</em> dresses; and there were a few plainly-dressed
women in the boxes. But where was that blaze of beauty and
fashion, of sparkling complexions and bright eyes, that streams like
a galaxy from the boxes of our Opera-house—like a Heaven of
loveliness let half-way down upon the earth, and charming ‘the
upturned eyes of wondering mortals,’ before which the thrilling
sounds that circle through the House seem to tremble with delight
and drink in new rapture from its conscious presence, and to which
the mimic Loves and Graces are proud to pay their distant, smiling
homage? Certainly it was not here; nor do I know where the sun
of beauty hides itself in France. I have seen but three rays of it
since I came, gilding a dark and pitchy cloud! It was not so in
Rousseau’s time, for these very <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Loges</span></i> were filled with the most
beautiful women of the Court, who came to see his <cite>Devin du Village</cite>,
and whom he heard murmuring around him in the softest accents—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tous
ces sons là vont au cœur!</span></i>’ The change is, I suppose, owing
to the Revolution; but whatever it is owing to, the monks have not,
by their return, banished this conventual gloom from their theatres;
nor is there any of that airy, flaunting, florid, butterfly, gauzy,
variegated appearance to be found in them that they have with us.
These gentlemen still keep up the farce of refusing actors burial in
consecrated ground; the mob pelt them, and the critics are even with
them by going to see the representation of the Tartuffe!</p>

<p class='c000'>I found but little at the Royal Academy of Music (as it is
affectedly called) to carry off this general dulness of effect, either
through the excellence or novelty of the performances. A Mademoiselle
Noel (who seems to be a favourite) made her <em>debut</em> in
Dido. Though there was nothing very striking, there was nothing
offensive in her representation of the character. For any thing that
appeared in her style of singing or acting, she might be a very pleasing,
modest, unaffected English girl performing on an English stage.
There was not a single trait of French <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravura</span></i> or grimace. Her
execution, however, seldom rose higher than an agreeable mediocrity;
and with considerable taste and feeling, her powers seemed to be
limited. She produced her chief effect in the latter and more
pathetic scenes, and ascended the funeral pile with dignity and
composure. Is it not strange (if contradictions and hasty caprices
taken up at random, and laid down as laws, were strange in this centre
of taste and refinement) that the French should raise such an outcry
against our assaults at arms and executions on the stage, and yet see a
young and beautiful female prepare to give herself the fatal blow,
without manifesting the smallest repugnance or dissatisfaction?—Æneas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and Iarbas were represented by Messrs. Mourritt and Derivis.
The first was insipid, the last a perfect Stentor. He spoke or sung
all through with an unmitigated ferocity of purpose and manner, and
with lungs that seemed to have been forged expressly for the occasion.
Ten bulls could not bellow louder, nor a whole street-full of frozen-out
gardeners at Christmas. His barbarous tunic and accoutrements
put one strongly in mind of Robinson Crusoe, while the modest
demeanour and painted complexion of the pious Æneas bore a considerable
analogy to the submissive advance and rosy cheeks of that
usual accompaniment of English travelling, who ushers himself into the
room at intervals, with awkward bows, and his hat twirled round in
his hands, ‘to hope you’ll remember the coachman.’ The Æneas
of the poet, however, was a shabby fellow, and had but justice done
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had leisure during this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">otiose</span></i> performance to look around me, and
as ‘it is my vice to spy into abuses,’ the first thing that struck me
was the prompter. Any Frenchman who has that sum at his
disposal, should give ten thousand francs a year for this situation. It
must be a source of ecstasy to him. For not an instant was he
quiet—tossing his hands in the air, darting them to the other side of the
score which he held before him in front of the stage, snapping his
fingers, nodding his head, beating time with his feet; and this not
mechanically, or as if it were a drudgery he was forced to go through,
and would be glad to have done with, but with unimpaired glee and
vehemence of gesture, jerking, twisting, fidgeting, wriggling, starting,
stamping, as if the incessant motion had fairly turned his head, and
every muscle in his frame were saturated with the spirit of quicksilver.
To be in continual motion for four hours, and to direct the
motions of others by the wagging of a finger, to be not only an object
of important attention to the stage and orchestra, but (in his own
imagination) to pit, boxes, and gallery, as the pivot on which the
whole grand machinery of that grandest of all machines, the French
Opera, turns—this is indeed, for a Parisian, the acme of felicity!
Every nerve must thrill with electrical satisfaction, and every pore
into which vanity can creep tingle with self-conceit! Not far from
this restless automaton (as if extremes met, or the volatility of youth
subsided into a sort of superannuated still-life) sat an old gentleman in
front of the pit, with his back to me, a white powdered head, the
curls sticking out behind, and a coat of the finest black. This was
all I saw of him for some time—he did not once turn his head or
shift his position, any more than a wig and coat stuck upon a barber’s
block—till I suddenly missed him, and soon after saw him seated on
the opposite side of the house, his face as yellow and hard as a piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of mahogany, but without expressing either pleasure or pain. Neither
the fiddlers’ elbows nor the dancers’ legs moved him one jot. His
fiddling fancies and his dancing-days were flown, and had left this
shadow, this profile, this mummy of a French gentleman of the old
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</span></i> behind. A Frenchman has no object in life but to talk and
move with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i>, and when he ceases to do either, he has no heart to
do any thing. Deprived of his vivacity, his thoughtlessness, his
animal spirits, he becomes a piece of costume, a finely-powdered wig,
an embroidered coat, a pair of shoe-buckles, a gold cane, or a snuff-box.
Drained of mere sensations and of their youthful blood, the
old fellows seem like the ghosts of the young ones, and have none of
their overweening offensiveness, or teasing officiousness. I can
hardly conceive of a young French <em>gentleman</em>, nor of an old one who
is otherwise. The latter come up to my <em>ideal</em> of this character, cut,
as it were, out of pasteboard, moved on springs, amenable to forms,
crimped and starched like a cravat, without a single tart ebullition, or
voluntary motion. Some of them may be seen at present gliding
along the walks of the Tuileries, and the sight of them is good for
sore eyes. They are also thinly sprinkled through the play-house;
for the drama and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</span></i> were in their time the amusement
and the privilege of the Court, and the contrast of their powdered
heads and pale faces makes the rest of the audience appear like a set
of greasy, impudent mechanics. A Frenchman is nothing without
powder, an Englishman is nothing with it. The character of the
one is artificial, that of the other natural. The women of France do
not submit to the regular approaches and the sober discipline of age
so well as the men. I had rather be in company with an old French
gentleman than a young one; I prefer a young Frenchwoman to an
old one. They aggravate the encroachments of age by contending
with them, and instead of displaying the natural graces and venerable
marks of that period of life, paint and patch their wrinkled faces,
and <em>toupee</em> and curl their grizzled locks, till they look like Friesland
hens, and are a caricature and burlesque of themselves. The old
women in France that figure at the theatre or elsewhere, have very
much the appearance of having kept a tavern or a booth at a fair, or
of having been mistresses of a place of another description, for the
greater part of their lives. A <em>mannish</em> hardened look and character
survives the wreck of beauty and of female delicacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of all things that I see here, it surprises me the most that the
French should fancy they can dance. To dance is to move with
grace and harmony to music. But the French, whether men or
women, have no idea of dancing but that of moving with agility, and
of distorting their limbs in every possible way, till they really alter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>the structure of the human form. By grace I understand the natural
movements of the human body, heightened into dignity or softened
into ease, each posture or step blending harmoniously into the rest.
There is grace in the waving of the branch of a tree or in the
bounding of a stag, because there is freedom and unity of motion.
But the French Opera-dancers think it graceful to stand on one leg
or on the points of their toes, or with one leg stretched out behind
them, as if they were going to be shod, or to raise one foot at right
angles with their bodies, and twirl themselves round like a <em>te-totum</em>,
to see how long they can spin, and then stop short all of a sudden;
or to skim along the ground, flat-footed, like a spider running along a
cobweb, or to pop up and down like a pea on a tobacco-pipe, or to
stick in their backs till another part projects out behind <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme des</span>
volails</i>, and to strut about like peacocks with infirm, vain-glorious
steps, or to turn out their toes till their feet resemble apes, or to
raise one foot above their heads, and turn swiftly round upon the
other, till the petticoats of the female dancers (for I have been thinking
of them) rise above their garters, and display a pair of spindle-shanks,
like the wooden ones of a wax-doll, just as shapeless and as
tempting. There is neither voluptuousness nor grace in a single
attitude or movement, but a very studious and successful attempt to
shew in what a number of uneasy and difficult positions the human
body can be put with the greatest rapidity of evolution. It is not
that they do all this with much more to redeem it, but they do all
this, and do nothing else. It would be very well as an exhibition of
tumbler’s tricks, or as rope-dancing (which are only meant to surprise),
but it is bad as Opera-dancing, if opera-dancing aspires to be one of
the Fine Arts, or even a handmaid to them; that is, to combine
with mechanical dexterity a sense of the beautiful in form and
motion, and a certain analogy to sentiment. ‘The common people,’
says the Author of <cite>Waverley</cite>, ‘always prefer exertion and agility to
grace.’ Is that the case also with the most refined people upon
earth? These antics and vagaries, this kicking of heels and shaking
of feet as if they would come off, might be excusable in the men, for
they shew a certain strength and muscular activity; but in the female
dancers they are unpardonable. What is said of poetry might be
applied to the sex. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non sat[is] est pulchra poemata esse, dulcia sunto.</span></i>
So women who appear in public, should be soft and lovely as well as
skilful and active, or they ought not to appear at all. They owe it to
themselves and others. As to some of the ridiculous extravagances
of this theatre, such as turning out their toes and holding back their
shoulders, one would have thought the Greek statues might have
taught their scientific professors better—if French artists did not see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>every thing with French eyes, and lament all that differs from their
established practice as a departure from the line of beauty. They
are sorry that the Venus does not hold up her head like a boarding-school
miss—</p>

<p class='c000'>In three months’ practice, and with proper tuition, Greek forms

Fanny and Noblet, I kiss your hands; but I have no pardon to beg
of Madame Le Gallois, for she looked like a lady (very tightly
laced) in the ballet, and played like a heroine in the pantomime part
of <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Folle par Amour</span></cite>. There was a violent start at the first
indication of her madness, that alarmed me a little, but all that
followed was natural, modest, and affecting in a high degree. The
French turn their Opera-stage into a mad-house; they turn their
mad-houses (at least they have one constructed on this principle)
into theatres of gaiety, where they rehearse ballets, operas, and plays.
If dancing were an antidote to madness, one would think the French
would be always in their right senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was told I ought to see <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nina, or La Folle par Amour</span></cite> at the Salle

be rather with a wish than from any hope of seeing it better done. I
went however.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was to see the <cite>Gazza Ladra</cite>. The house was full, the evening
sultry, a hurry and bustle in the lobbies, an eagerness in the looks of
the assembled crowd. The audience seemed to be in earnest, and to
have imbibed an interest from the place. On the stage there were
rich dresses and voices, the tones of passion, ease, nature, animation;
in short, the scene had a soul in it. One wondered how one was in
Paris, with their pasteboard maps of the passions, and thin-skinned,
dry-lipped humour. Signora Mombelli played the humble, but
interesting heroine charmingly, with truth, simplicity, and feeling.
Her voice is neither rich nor sweet, but it is clear as a bell. Signor
Pellegrini played the intriguing Magistrate, with a solemnity and
farcical drollery, that I would not swear is much inferior to Liston.
But I swear, that Brunet (whom I saw the other night, and had seen
before without knowing it) is not equal to Liston. Yet he is a
feeble, quaint diminutive of that original. He squeaks and gibbers
oddly enough at the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théâtre des Variétés</span></cite>, like a mouse in the hollow
of a musty cheese, his small eyes peering out, and his sharp teeth
nibbling at the remains of some faded joke. The French people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>quality go to the Italian Opera, but they do not attend to it. The
<em>tabbies</em> of the Court are tabbies still; and took no notice of what was
passing on the stage on this occasion, till the tolling of the bell made
a louder and more disagreeable noise than themselves; this they
seemed to like. They behave well at their own theatres, but it
would be a breach of etiquette to do so anywhere else. A girl in
the gallery (an Italian by her complexion, and from her interest in
the part) was crying bitterly at the story of the <cite>Maid and the Magpie</cite>,
while three Frenchmen, in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Troisième Loge</span></cite>, were laughing at her
the whole time. I said to one of them, ‘It was not a thing to laugh
at, but to admire.’ He turned away, as if the remark did not come
within his notions of sentiment. This did not stagger me in my
theory of the French character; and when one is possessed of nothing
but a theory, one is glad, not sorry to keep it, though at the expense
of others.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class='c008'>We left Paris in the Diligence, and arrived at Fontainbleau the
first night. The accommodations at the inn were indifferent, and
not cheap. The palace is a low straggling mass of very old
buildings, having been erected by St. Louis in the 12th century,
whence he used to date his Rescripts, ‘From my Deserts of Fontainbleau!’
It puts one in mind of Monkish legends, of faded
splendour, of the leaden spouts and uncouth stone-cherubim of a
country church-yard. It is empty or gaudy within, stiff and heavy
without. Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> figures on the walls with the fair Gabrielle,
like the Tutelary Satyr of the place, keeping up the remembrance
of old-fashioned royalty and gallantry. They here shew you the
table (a plain round piece of mahogany) on which Buonaparte in
1814 signed <em>the abdication of the human race, in favour of the hereditary
proprietors of the species</em>. We walked forward a mile or two
before the coach the next day on the road to Montargis. It presents
a long, broad, and stately avenue without a turning, as far as the eye
can reach, and is skirted on each side by a wild, woody, rocky
scenery. The birch-trees, with their grey stems and light glittering
branches, silvered over the darker back-ground, and afforded a
striking contrast to the brown earth and green moss beneath. There
was a stillness in the woods, which affects the mind the more in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>objects whose very motion is gentleness. The day was dull, but
quite mild, though in the middle of January. The situation of
Fontainbleau is certainly interesting and fine. It stands in the midst
of an extensive forest, intersected with craggy precipices and rugged
ranges of hills; and the various roads leading to or from it are cut out
of a wilderness, which a hermit might inhabit. The approach to the
different towns in France has, in this respect, the advantage over
ours; for, from burning wood instead of coal, they must have large
woods in the neighbourhood, which clothe the country round them,
and afford, as Pope expresses it,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘In summer shade, in winter fire.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We dig our fuel out of the bowels of the earth, and have a greater
portion of its surface left at our disposal, which we devote not to
ornament, but use. A copse-wood or an avenue of trees however,
makes a greater addition to the beauty of a town than a coal-pit or
a steam-engine in its vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Diligence came up, and we took our seats in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</span></i>
(which is that part of a French stage-coach which resembles an old
shattered post-chaise, placed in front of the main body of it) we found
a French lady occupying the third place in it, whose delight at our
entrance was as great as if we had joined her on some desert island,
and whose mortification was distressing when she learnt we were not
going the whole way with her. She complained of the cold of the
night air; but this she seemed to dread less than the want of
company. She said she had been deceived, for she had been told
the coach was full, and was in despair that she should not have a
soul to speak to all the way to Lyons. We got out, notwithstanding,
at the inn at Montargis, where we met with a very
tolerable reception, and were waited on at supper by one of those
Maritorneses that perfectly astonish an English traveller. Her joy
at our arrival was as extreme as if her whole fortune depended on
it. She laughed, danced, sung, fairly sprung into the air, bounced
into the room, nearly overset the table, hallooed and talked
as loud as if she had been alternately ostler and chamber-maid.
She was as rough and boisterous as any country bumpkin at a wake
or statute-fair; and yet so full of rude health and animal spirits, that
you were pleased instead of being offended. In England, a girl
with such boorish manners would not be borne; but her good-humour
kept pace with her coarseness, and she was as incapable of
giving as of feeling pain. There is something in the air in France
that carries off the <em>blue devils</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'>The mistress of the inn, however, was a little peaking, pining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>woman, with her face wrapped up in flannel, and not quite so
inaccessible to nervous impressions; and when I asked the girl,
‘What made her speak so loud?’ she answered for her, ‘To make
people deaf!’ This side-reproof did not in the least moderate the
brazen tones of her help-mate, but rather gave a new fillip to her
spirits; though she was less on the alert than the night before, and
appeared to the full as much bent on arranging her curls in the
looking-glass when she came into the room, as on arranging the
breakfast things on the tea-board.</p>

<p class='c000'>We staid here till one o’clock on Sunday (the 16th,) waiting the
arrival of the Lyonnais, in which we had taken our places forward,
and which I thought would never arrive. Let no man trust to a
placard stuck on the walls of Paris, advertising the cheapest and
most expeditious mode of conveyance to all parts of the world.
It may be no better than a snare to the unwary. The Lyonnais,
I thought from the advertisement, was the <em>Swift-sure</em> of Diligences.
It was to arrive ten hours before any other Diligence; it was the
most compact, the most elegant of modern vehicles. From the
description and the print of it, it seemed ‘a thing of life,’ a minion
of the fancy. To see it stand in a state of disencumbered abstraction,
it appeared a self-impelling machine; or if it needed aid, was horsed,
unlike your Paris Diligences, by nimble, airy Pegasuses. To look
at the <em>fac-simile</em> of it that was put into your hand, you would
say it might run or fly—might traverse the earth, or whirl you
through the air, without let or impediment, so light was it to
outward appearance in structure ‘fit for speed succinct’—a chariot
for <em>Puck</em> or <em>Ariel</em> to ride in! This was the account I had (or something
like it) from Messieurs the Proprietors at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cour des Fontaines</span></i>.
‘Mark how a plain tale shall put them down.’ Those gentlemen
came to me after I had paid for two places as far as Nevers, to ask
me to resign them in favour of two Englishmen, who wished to go
the whole way, and to re-engage them for the following evening.
I said I could not do that; but as I had a dislike to travelling at
night, I would go on to Montargis by some other conveyance, and
proceed by the Lyonnais, which would arrive there at eight or
nine on Sunday morning, as far as I could that night. I set out on
the faith of this understanding. I had some difficulty in finding the
Office <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sur la place</span></i>, to which I had been directed, and which was
something between a stable, a kitchen, and a cook-shop. I was led
to it by a shabby <em>double</em> or counterpart of the Lyonnais, which stood
before the door, empty, dirty, bare of luggage, waiting the Paris
one, which had not yet arrived. It drove into town four hours
afterwards, with three foundered <em>hacks</em>, with the postilion and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i> for its complement of passengers, the last occupying the
left hand corner of the <em>coupé</em> in solitary state, with a whisp of straw
thrust through a broken pane of one of the front windows, and a
tassel of blue and yellow fringe hanging out of the other; and with
that mixture of despondency and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fierté</span></i> in his face, which long and
uninterrupted pondering on the state of the way-bill naturally
produces in such circumstances. He seized upon me and my
trunks as lawful prize; he afterwards insisted on my going forward
in the middle of the night to Lyons, (contrary to my agreement,)
and I was obliged to comply, or to sleep upon trusses of straw in
a kind of out-house. We quarrelled incessantly, but I could not
help laughing, for he sometimes looked like my old acquaintance,
Dr. S., and sometimes like my friend, A—— H——, of
Edinburgh. He said we should reach Lyons the next evening,
and we got there twenty-four hours after the time. He told me
for my comfort, the reason of his being so late was, that two of his
horses had fallen down dead on the road. He had to raise relays
of horses all the way, as if we were travelling through a hostile
country; quarrelled with all the postilions about an abatement of
a few sous; and once our horses were arrested in the middle of the
night by a farmer who refused to trust him; and he had to go
before the Mayor, as soon as day broke. We were quizzed by the
post-boys, the innkeepers, the peasants all along the road, as a
shabby concern; our <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i> bore it all, like another <cite>Candide</cite>.
We stopped at all the worst inns in the outskirts of the towns,
where nothing was ready; or when it was, was not eatable. The
second morning we were to breakfast at Moulins; when we
alighted, our guide told us it was eleven: the clock in the kitchen
pointed to three. As he laughed in my face when I complained
of his misleading me, I told him that he was ‘<i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">un impudent</span></i>,’ and this
epithet sobered him the rest of the way. As we left Moulins, the
crimson clouds of evening streaked the west, and I had time to
think of Sterne’s <cite>Maria</cite>. The people at the inn, I suspect, had
never heard of her. There was no trace of romance about the
house. Certainly, mine was not a Sentimental Journey. Is it not
provoking to come to a place, that has been consecrated by ‘famous
poet’s pen,’ as a breath, a name, a fairy-scene, and find it a dull,
dirty town? Let us leave the realities to shift for themselves, and
think only of those bright tracts that have been reclaimed for us by
the fancy, where the perfume, the sound, the vision, and the joy
still linger, like the soft light of evening skies! Is the story of
Maria the worse, because I am travelling a dirty road in a rascally
Diligence? Or is it an injury done us by the author to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>invented for us what we should not have met with in reality?
Has it not been read with pleasure by thousands of readers,
though the people at the inn had never heard of it? Yet
Sterne would have been vexed to find that the fame of his
Maria had never reached the little town of Moulins. We are
always dissatisfied with the good we have, and always punished for
our unreasonableness.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Palisseau (the road is rich in melodramatic recollections) it
became pitch-dark; you could not see your hand; I entreated to
have the lamp lighted; our <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i> said it was broken (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cassé</span></i>).
With much persuasion, and the ordering a bottle of their best wine,
which went round among the people at the inn, we got a lantern with
a rushlight in it, but the wind soon blew it out, and we went on our
way darkling; the road lay over a high hill, with a loose muddy
bottom between two hedges, and as we did not attempt to trot or
gallop, we came safe to the level ground on the other side. We
breakfasted at Rouane, where we were first shewn into the kitchen,
while they were heating a suffocating stove in a squalid <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle à
manger</span></i>. There, while I was sitting half dead with cold and fatigue,
a boy came and scraped a wooden dresser close at my ear, with a
noise to split one’s brain, and with true French <em>nonchalance</em>; and a
portly landlady, who had risen just as we had done breakfasting,
ushered us to our carriage with the airs and graces of a Madame
Maintenon. In France you meet with the court address in a
stable-yard. In other countries you may find grace in a cottage or
a wilderness; but it is simple, unconscious grace, without the full-blown
pride and strut of <em>mannered</em> confidence and presumption.
A woman in France is graceful by going out of her sphere; not
by keeping within it.—In crossing the bridge at Rouane, the sun
shone brightly on the river and shipping, which had a busy cheerful
aspect; and we began to ascend the Bourbonnois under more
flattering auspices. We got out and walked slowly up the sounding
road. I found that the morning air refreshed and braced my spirits;
and that even the continued fatigue of the journey, which I had
dreaded as a hazardous experiment, was a kind of seasoning to me.
I was less exhausted than the first day. I will venture to say,
that for an invalid, sitting up all night is better than lying in bed
all day. Hardships, however dreadful to nervous apprehensions,
by degrees give us strength and resolution to endure them: whereas
effeminacy softens and renders us less and less capable of encountering
pain or difficulty. It is the love of indulgence, or the shock of the
first privation or effort, that confirms almost all the weaknesses of
body or mind. As we loitered up the long, winding ascent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>road from Rouane, we occasionally approached the brink of some
Alpine declivity tufted with pine trees, and noticed the white villas,
clustering [or] scattered, which in all directions spotted the very
summits of that vast and gradual amphitheatre of hills which
overlooked the neighbouring town. The Bourbonnois is the first
large chain of hills piled one upon another, and extending range
beyond range, that you come to on the route to Italy, and that
occupy a wide-spread district, like a mighty conqueror, with uniform
and growing magnificence. To those who have chiefly seen
detached mountains or abrupt precipices rising from the level surface
of the ground, the effect is exceedingly imposing and grand. The
descent on the other side into Tarare is more sudden and dangerous;
and you avoid passing over the top of the mountain (along which
the road formerly ran) by one of those fine, broad, firmly-cemented
roads with galleries and bridges, which bespeak at once the master-hand
that raised them. Tarare is a neat little town, famous for the
manufacture of serges and calicoes. We had to stop here for three-quarters
of an hour, waiting for fresh horses; and as we sat in the
<em>coupé</em> in this helpless state, the horses taken out, the sun shining in,
and the wind piercing through every cranny of the broken panes and
rattling sash-windows, the postilion came up and demanded to know
if we were English, as there were two English gentlemen who
would be glad to see us. I excused myself from getting out, but
said I should be happy to speak to them. Accordingly, my
informant beckoned to a young man in black, who was standing at a
little distance in a state of anxious expectation, and who coming to
the coach-door said, he presumed we were from London, and that
he had taken the liberty to pay his respects to us. His friend, he
said, who was staying with him, was ill in bed, or he would have
done himself the same pleasure. He had on a pair of wooden clogs,
turned up and pointed at the toes in the manner of the country
(which he recommended to me as useful for climbing the hills if
ever I should come into those parts) warm worsted mittens, and had
a thin, genteel, shivering aspect. I expected every moment he
would tell me his name or business; but all I learnt was that he and
his friend had been here some time, and that they could not get
away till spring, that there were no entertainments, that trade was
flat, and that the French seemed to him a very different people from
the English. The fact is, he found himself quite at a loss in a
French country-town, and had no other resource or way of amusing
himself, than by looking out for the Diligences as they passed, and
trying to hear news from England. He stood at his own door, and
waved his hand with a melancholy air as we rode by, and no doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>instantly went up stairs to communicate to his sick friend, that he
had conversed with two English people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our delay at Tarare had deprived us of nearly an hour of daylight;
and, besides, the miserable foundered jades of horses, that
we had to get on with in this paragon of Diligences, were quite
unequal to the task of dragging it up and down the hills on the road
to Lyons, which was still twenty miles distant. The night was
dark, and we had no light. I found it was quite hopeless when we
should reach our journey’s end (if we did not break our necks by
the way) and that both were matters of very great indifference to
Mons. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Conducteur</span></i>, who was only bent on saving the pockets of
Messieurs his employers, and who had no wish, like me, to see the
Vatican! He affected to make bargains for horses, which always
failed and added to our delay; and lighted his lantern once or twice,
but it always went out. At last I said that I had intended to give
him a certain sum for himself, but that if we did not arrive in Lyons
by ten o’clock at night, he might depend upon it I would not give
him a single farthing. This had the desired effect. He got out
at the next village we came to, and three stout horses were fastened
to the harness. He also procured a large piece of candle (with a
reserve of another piece of equal length and thickness in his lantern)
and held it in his hand the whole way, only shifting it from one
hand to the other, as he grew tired, and biting his lips and making
wry faces at this new office of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">candelabrum</span></i>, which had been thrust
upon him much against his will. I was not sorry, for he was one of
the most disagreeable Frenchmen I ever met with, having all
the indifference and self-sufficiency of his countrymen with none of
their usual obligingness. He seemed to me a person out of his place
(a thing you rarely discover in France)—a broken-down tradesman,
or ‘one that had had misfortunes,’ and who neither liked nor was
fit for his present situation of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i> to a Diligence without
funds, without horses, and without passengers. We arrived in safety
at Lyons at eleven o’clock at night, and were conducted to the <em>Hotel
des Couriers</em>, where we, with some difficulty, procured a lodging and
a supper, and were attended by a brown, greasy, dark-haired, good-humoured,
awkward gypsey of a wench from the south of France,
who seemed just caught; stared and laughed, and forgot every thing
she went for; could not help exclaiming every moment—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que
Madame a le peau blanc!</span></i>’ from the contrast to her own dingy complexion
and dirty skin, took a large brass-pan of scalding milk, came
and sat down by me on a bundle of wood, and drank it; said she had
had no supper, for her head ached, and declared the English were
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">braves gens</span></i>, and that the Bourbons were <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons enfans</span></i>, started up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>look through the key-hole, and whispered through her broad strong-set
teeth, that a fine Madam was descending the staircase, who had
been to dine with a great gentleman, offered to take away the supper
things, left them, and called us the next morning with her head and
senses in a state of even greater confusion than they were over-night.
The familiarity of common servants in France surprises the English
at first; but it has nothing offensive in it, any more than the good
natured gambols and freedoms of a Newfoundland dog. It is quite
natural.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lyons is a fine, dirty town. The streets are good, but so high
and narrow, that they look like sinks of filth and gloom. The shops
are mere dungeons. Yet two noble rivers water the city, the Rhone
and the Saone—the one broad and majestic, the other more confined
and impetuous in its course, and join a little below the town to pour
their friendly streams into the Mediterranean. The square is spacious
and handsome, and the heights of St. Just, that overlook it, command
a fine view of the town, the bridges, both rivers, the hills of Provence,
the road to Chambery, and the Alps, with their snowy tops propping
the clouds. The sight of them effectually deterred me from attempting
to go by Geneva and the Simplon; and we were contented (for
this time) with the humbler passage of Mount Cenis. Here is the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hotel de Notre Dâme de Piété</span></i>, which is shewn you as the inn where
Rousseau stopped on his way to Paris, when he went to overturn the
French Monarchy by the force of style. I thought of him, as we
came down the mountain of Tarare, in his gold-laced hat, and with
his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jet d’eau</span></i> playing. If they could but have known who was coming,
how many battalions would have been sent out to meet him; what
a ringing of alarm-bells, what a beating of drums, what raising of
drawbridges, what barring of gates, what examination of passports,
what processions of priests, what meetings of magistrates, what
confusion in the towns, what a panic through the country, what
telegraphic despatches to the Court of Versailles, what couriers
posting to all parts of Europe, what manifestoes from armies, what
a hubbub of Holy Alliances, and all for what? To prevent one
man from speaking what he and every other man felt, and whose
only fault was that the beatings of the human heart had found an
echo in his pen! At Lyons I saw this inscription over a door:
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ici on trouve le seul et unique depôt de l’encre sans pareil et incorruptible</span></i>—which
appeared to me to contain the whole secret of French poetry.
I went into a shop to buy M. Martine’s <cite>Death of Socrates</cite>, which I
saw in the window, but they would neither let me have that copy nor
get me another. The French are not ‘a nation of shopkeepers.’
They had quite as lieve see you walk out of their shops as come into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>them. While I was waiting for an answer, a French servant in
livery brought in four volumes of the <cite>History of a Foundling</cite>, an
improved translation, in which it was said the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceaux</span></i> omitted
by M. de la Place were restored. I was pleased to see my old
acquaintance Tom Jones, with his French coat on. The poetry
of M. Alphonse Martine and of M. Casimir de la Vigne circulates
in the provinces and in Italy, through the merit of the authors and
the favour of the critics. L. H. tells me that the latter is a great
Bonapartist, and talks of ‘the tombs of the brave.’ He said I might
form some idea of M. Martine’s attempts to be great and <em>unfrenchified</em>
by the frontispiece to one of his poems, in which a young gentleman
in an heroic attitude is pointing to the sea in a storm, with his other
hand round a pretty girl’s waist. I told H. this poet had lately
married a lady of fortune. He said, ‘That’s the girl.’ He also
said very well, I thought, that ‘the French seemed born to puzzle
the Germans.’ Why are there not salt-spoons in France? In
England it is a piece of barbarism to put your knife into a salt-cellar
with another. But in France the distinction between grossness and
refinement is done away. Every thing there is refined!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p class='c008'>There was a Diligence next day for Turin over Mount Cenis, which
went only twice a week (stopping at night) and I was glad to secure
(as I thought) two places in the interior at seventy francs a seat, for
240 miles. The fare from Paris to Lyons, a distance of 360 miles,
was only fifty francs each, which is four times as cheap; but the
difference was accounted for to me, from there being no other conveyance,
which was an arbitrary reason, and from the number and expense
of horses necessary to drag a heavy double coach over mountainous
roads. Besides, it was a Royal Messagerie, and I was given to
understand that Messrs. Bonnafoux paid the King of Sardinia a
thousand crowns a year for permission to run a Diligence through
his territories. The knave of a waiter (I found) had cheated me;
and that from Chambery there was only one place in the interior and
one in the <em>coupé</em>, which turned out to be a cabriolet, a place in front
with a leathern apron and curtains, which in winter time, and in
travelling over snowy mountains and through icy valleys, was not a
situation ‘devoutly to be wished.’ I had no other resource, however,
having paid my four pounds in advance at the over-pressing instances
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garçon</span></i>, but to call him a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coquin</span></i>, (which being a Milanese was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>not quite safe) to throw out broad hints (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l’Anglais</span></i>) of a collusion
between him and the Office, and to arrange as well as I could with
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i>, that I and my fellow-traveller should not be separated.
I would advise all English people travelling abroad to take their own
places at coach-offices, and not to trust to waiters, who will make a
point of tricking them, both as a principle and pastime; and further
to procure letters of recommendation (in case of disagreeable accidents
on the road) for it was a knowledge of this kind, namely, that I had
a letter of introduction to one of the Professors of the College at
Lyons, that procured me even the trifling concession above-mentioned,
through the influence which the landlady of the Hotel had with the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i>: otherwise, instead of being stuck in the cabriolet, I
might have mounted on the imperial, and any signs of vexation or
impatience I might have exhibited, would have been construed into
ebullitions of the national character, and a want of <em>bienseance</em> in
Monsieur l’Anglois. The French, and foreigners in general, (as
far as I have seen) are civil, polite, easy-tempered, obliging; but
the art of keeping up plausible appearances stands them in lieu of
downright honesty. They think they have a right to cheat you if
they can (a compliment, a civil bow, a shrug, is worth the money!)
and the instant you find out the imposition or begin to complain, they
turn away from you as a disagreeable or wrong-headed person, and
you can get no redress but by main force. It is not the original
transgressor, but he who declares he is aggrieved, that is considered
as guilty of a breach of good manners, and a disturber of the social
compact. I think one is more irritated at the frequent impositions
that are practised on one abroad, because the novelty of the scene,
one’s ignorance of the ways of the world, and the momentary excitement
of the spirits and of the flush of hope, have a tendency to renew
in one’s mind the unsuspecting simplicity and credulity of youth; and
the petty tricks and shuffling behaviour we meet with on the road
are a greater baulk to our warm, sanguine, buoyant, travelling
impulses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Annoyed at the unfair way in which we had been treated, and at
the idea of being left to the mercy of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Conducteur</span></i>, whose ‘honest,
sonsie, bawsont face’ had, however, no more of the fox in it than
implied an eye to his own interest, and might be turned to our own
advantage, we took our seats numerically in the Royal Diligence of
Italy, at seven in the evening (January 20) and for some time suffered
the extreme penalties of a French stage-coach—not indeed ‘the icy
fang and season’s difference,’ but a very purgatory of heat, closeness,
confinement, and bad smells. Nothing can surpass it but the section
of a slave-ship, or the Black-hole of Calcutta. Mr. Theodore Hook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>or Mr. Croker should take an airing in this way on the Continent,
in order to give them a notion of, and I should think, a distaste for
the blessings of the Middle Passage. Not only were the six places
in the interior all taken, and all full, but they had suspended a wicker
basket (like a hen-coop) from the top of the coach, stuffed with fur-caps,
hats, overalls, and different parcels, so as to make it impossible
to move one way or other, and to stop every remaining breath of air.
A <i><span lang="ca" xml:lang="ca">negociant</span></i> at my right-hand corner, who was inclined to piece out a
lengthened recital with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parce que</span></i> and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de sorte que</span></i> at every word,
having got upon ticklish ground, without seeing his audience, was cut
short in the flower of his oratory, by asserting that Barcelona and
St. Sebastian’s in Spain were contiguous to each other. ‘They were
at opposite sides of the country,’ exclaimed in the same breath a
French soldier and a Spaniard, who sat on the other side of the
coach, and whom he was regaling with the gallant adventures of a
friend of his in the Peninsula, and not finding the usual excuse—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est
égal</span></i>‘—applicable to a blunder in geography, was contented to
fall into the rear of the discourse for the rest of the journey. At
midnight we found that we had gone only nine miles in five hours,
as we had been climbing a gradual ascent from the time we set out,
which was our first essay in mountain-scenery, and gave us some
idea of the scale of the country we were beginning to traverse. The
heat became less insupportable as the noise and darkness subsided;
and as the morning dawned, we were anxious to remove that veil of
uncertainty and prejudice which the obscurity of night throws over a
number of passengers whom accident has huddled together in a stage-coach.
I think one seldom finds one’s-self set down in a party of
this kind without a strong feeling of repugnance and distaste, and one
seldom quits it at last without some degree of regret. It was the
case in the present instance. At day-break, the pleasant farms, the
thatched cottages, and sloping valleys of Savoy attracted our notice,
and I was struck with the resemblance to England (to some parts of
Devonshire and Somersetshire in particular) a discovery which I
imparted to my fellow-travellers with a more lively enthusiasm than
it was received. An Englishman thinks he has only to communicate
his feelings to others to meet with sympathy, and is not a little
disconcerted if (after this amazing act of condescension) he is at all
repulsed. How should we laugh at a Frenchman who expected us
to be delighted with his finding out a likeness of some part of
England to France? We English are a nation of egotists, say what
we will; and so much so, that we expect others to swallow the bait
of our self-love.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Pont Beau-Voisin, the frontier town of the King of Sardinia’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>dominions, we stopped to breakfast, and to have our passports and
luggage examined at the Barrier and Custom-house. I breakfasted
with the Spaniard, who invited himself to our tea-party, and complimented
Madame (in broken English) on the excellence of her
performance. We agreed between ourselves that the Spaniards and
English were very much superior to the French. I found he had
a taste for the Fine Arts, and I spoke of Murillo and Velasquez as
two excellent Spanish painters. ‘Here was sympathy.’ I also
spoke of Don Quixote—‘Here was more sympathy.’ What a thing
it is to have produced a work that makes friends of all the world that
have read it, and that all the world have read! Mention but Don
Quixote, and who is there that does not own him for a friend,
countryman, and brother? There is no French work, at the name
of which (as at a talisman) the scales of national prejudice so
completely fall off; nay more, I must confess there is no English
one. We were summoned from our tea and patriotic effusions to
attend the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Douane</span></i>. It was striking to have to pass and repass the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquets</span> of soldiers stationed as a guard on bridges across narrow
mountain-streams that a child might leap over. After some slight
dalliance with our great-coat pockets, and significant gestures as if
we might or might not have things of value about us that we should
not, we proceeded to the Custom-house. I had two trunks. One
contained books. When it was unlocked, it was as if the lid of
Pandora’s box flew open. There could not have been a more sudden
start or expression of surprise, had it been filled with cartridge-paper
or gun-powder. Books were the corrosive sublimate that
eat out despotism and priestcraft—the artillery that battered down
castle and dungeon-walls—the ferrets that ferreted out abuses—the
lynx-eyed guardians that tore off disguises—the scales that weighed
right and wrong—the thumping make-weight thrown into the balance
that made force and fraud, the sword and the cowl, kick the beam—the
dread of knaves, the scoff of fools—the balm and the consolation
of the human mind—the salt of the earth—the future rulers of the
world! A box full of them was a contempt of the constituted
Authorities; and the names of mine were taken down with great care
and secrecy—Lord Bacon’s ‘Advancement of Learning,’ Milton’s
‘Paradise Lost,’ De Stutt-Tracey’s ‘Ideologie,’ (which Bonaparte
said ruined his Russian expedition,) Mignet’s ‘French Revolution,’
(which wants a chapter on the English Government,) ‘Sayings and
Doings,’ with pencil notes in the margin, ‘Irving’s Orations,’ the
same, an ‘Edinburgh Review,’ some ‘Morning Chronicles,’ ‘The
Literary Examiner,’ a collection of Poetry, a Volume bound in
crimson velvet, and the Paris edition of ‘Table-talk.’ Here was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>some questionable matter enough—but no notice was taken. My box
was afterwards corded and <em>leaded</em> with equal gravity and politeness,
and it was not till I arrived at Turin that I found it was a prisoner of
state, and would be forwarded to me anywhere I chose to mention,
out of his Sardinian Majesty’s dominions. I was startled to find
myself within the smooth polished grasp of legitimate power, without
suspecting it; and was glad to recover my trunk at Florence, with
no other inconvenience than the expense of its carriage across the
country.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was noon as we returned to the inn, and we first caught a full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>view of the Alps over a plashy meadow, some feathery trees, and the
tops of the houses of the village in which we were. It was a
magnificent sight, and in truth a new sensation. Their summits were
bright with snow and with the midday sun; they did not seem to
stand upon the earth, but to prop the sky; they were at a considerable
distance from us, and yet appeared just over our heads. The surprise
seemed to take away our breath, and to lift us from our feet. It was
drinking the empyrean. As we could not long retain possession of
our two places in the interior, I proposed to our guide to exchange
them for the cabriolet; and, after some little chaffering and candid
representations of the outside passengers of the cold we should have
to encounter, we were installed there to our great satisfaction, and the
no less contentment of those whom we succeeded. Indeed I had no
idea that we should be steeped in these icy valleys at three o’clock in
the morning, or I might have hesitated. The view was cheering,
the clear air refreshing, and I thought we should set off each morning
about seven or eight. But it is part of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sçavoir vivre</span></i> in France,
and one of the methods of adding to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrémens</span></i> of travelling, to set
out three hours before day-break in the depth of winter, and stop two
hours about noon, in order to arrive early in the evening. With all
the disadvantages of preposterous hours and of intense cold pouring
into the cabriolet like water the two first mornings, I cannot say
I repented of my bargain. We had come a thousand miles to see
the Alps for one thing, and we <em>did</em> see them in perfection, which we
could not have done inside. The ascent for some way was striking
and full of novelty; but on turning a corner of the road we entered
upon a narrow defile or rocky ledge, overlooking a steep valley under
our feet, with a headlong turbid stream dashing down it, and spreading
itself out into a more tranquil river below, a dark wood of innumerable
pine-trees covering the side of the valley opposite, with broken crags,
morasses, and green plots of cultivated ground, orchards, and quiet
homesteads, on which the sun glanced its farewell rays through the
openings of the mountains. On our left, a precipice of dark brown
rocks of various shapes rose abruptly at our side, or hung threatening
over the road, into which some of their huge fragments, loosened by
the winter’s flaw, had fallen, and which men and mules were
employed in removing—(the thundering crash had hardly yet subsided,
as you looked up and saw the fleecy clouds sailing among the
shattered cliffs, while another giant-mass seemed ready to quit its
station in the sky)—and as the road wound along to the other
extremity of this noble pass, between the beetling rocks and dark
sloping pine-forests, frowning defiance at each other, you caught the
azure sky, the snowy ridges of the mountains, and the peaked tops of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the Grand Chartreuse, waving to the right in solitary state and air-clad
brightness.—It was a scene dazzling, enchanting, and that
stamped the long-cherished dreams of the imagination upon the
senses. Between those four crystal peaks stood the ancient monastery
of that name, hid from the sight, revealed to thought, half-way
between earth and heaven, enshrined in its cerulean atmosphere,
lifting the soul to its native home, and purifying it from mortal
grossness. I cannot wonder at the pilgrimages that are made to it,
its calm repose, its vows monastic. Life must there seem a noiseless
dream;—Death a near translation to the skies! Winter was even
an advantage to this scene. The black forests, the dark sides of the
rocks gave additional and inconceivable brightness to the glittering
summits of the lofty mountains, and received a deeper tone and a
more solemn gloom from them; while in the open spaces the unvaried
sheets of snow fatigue the eye, which requires the contrast of the
green tints or luxuriant foliage of summer or of spring. This was
more particularly perceptible as the day closed, when the golden
sunset streamed in vain over frozen valleys that imbibed no richness
from it, and repelled its smile from their polished marble surface.
But in the more gloomy and desert regions, the difference is less
remarkable between summer and winter, except in the beginning of
spring, when the summits of the hoary rocks are covered with snow,
and the cleft[s] in their sides are filled with fragrant shrubs and
flowers. I hope to see this miracle when I return.</p>

<p class='c000'>We came to Echelles, where we changed horses with great
formality and preparation, as if setting out on some formidable
expedition. Six large strong-boned horses with high haunches (used
to ascend and descend mountains) were put to, the rope-tackle was
examined and repaired, and our two postilions mounted and dismounted
more than once, before they seemed willing to set off, which
they did at last at a hand-gallop, that was continued for some miles.
It is nothing to see English blood-horses get over the ground with
such prodigious fleetness and spirit, but it is really curious to see the
huge cart-horses, that they use for Diligences abroad, lumbering along
and making the miles disappear behind them with their ponderous
strength and persevering activity. The road for some way rattled
under their heavy hoofs, and the heavy wheels that they dragged or
whirled along at a thundering pace; the postilions cracked their
whips, and the one in front (a dark, swarthy, short-set fellow)
flourished his, shouted and hallooed, and turned back to vociferate his
instructions to his companion with the robust energy and wildness of
expression of a smuggler or a leader of banditti, carrying off a rich
booty from a troop of soldiers. There was something in the scenery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to favour this idea. Night was falling as we entered the superb
tunnel cut through the mountain at La Grotte (a work attributed to
Victor-Emanuel, with the same truth that Falstaff took to himself the
merit of the death of Hotspur), and its iron floor rang, the whips
cracked, and the roof echoed to the clear voice of our intrepid
postilion as we dashed through it. Our path then wound among
romantic defiles, where huge masses of snow and the gathering gloom
threatened continually to bar our way; but it seemed cleared by the
lively shout of our guide, and the carriage-wheels, clogged with ice,
rolled after the heavy tramp of the horses. In this manner we rode
on through a country full of wild grandeur and shadowy fears, till we
had nearly reached the end of our day’s journey, when we dismissed
our two fore-horses and their rider, to whom I presented a trifling
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">douceur</span></i> ‘for the sake of his good voice and cheerful countenance.’
The descent into Chambery was the most dangerous part of the road,
and our horses were nearly thrown on their haunches several times.
The road was narrow and slippery; there were a number of market-carts
returning from the town, and there was a declivity on one side,
which, though not a precipice, was quite sufficient to have dashed us
to pieces in a common-place way. We arrived at Chambery in the
dusk of the evening; and there is surely a charm in the name, and in
that of the Charmettes near it (where he who relished all more
sharply than his fellows, and made them feel for him as for themselves,
alone felt peace or hope), which even the Magdalen Muse
of Mr. Moore has not been able to <em>unsing</em>! We alighted at the inn
fatigued enough, and were delighted on being shewn to a room to find
the floor of wood, and English teacups and saucers. We were in
Savoy.</p>

<p class='c000'>We set out early the next morning, and it was the most trying
part of our whole journey. The wind cut like a scythe through the
valleys, and a cold, icy feeling struck from the sides of the snowy
precipices that surrounded us, so that we seemed enclosed in a huge
well of mountains. We got to St. Jean de Maurienne to breakfast
about noon, where the only point agreed upon appeared to be to have
nothing ready to receive us. This was the most tedious day of all;
nor did we meet with any thing to repay us for our uncomfortable
setting out. We travelled through a scene of desolation, were chilled
in sunless valleys or dazzled by sunny mountain-tops, passed frozen
streams or gloomy cavities, that might be transformed into the scene
of some Gothic wizard’s spell, or reminded one of some German
novel. Let no one imagine that the crossing the Alps is the work
of a moment, or done by a single heroic effort—that they are a huge
but detached chain of hills, or like the dotted line we find in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>map. They are a sea or an entire kingdom of mountains. It took
us three days to traverse them in this, which is the most practicable
direction, and travelling at a good round pace. We passed on as far
as eye could see, and still we appeared to have made little way.
Still we were in the shadow of the same enormous mass of rock and
snow, by the side of the same creeping stream. Lofty mountains
reared themselves in front of us—horrid abysses were scooped out
under our feet. Sometimes the road wound along the side of a steep
hill, overlooking some village-spire or hamlet, and as we ascended it,
it only gave us a view of remoter scenes, ‘where Alps o’er Alps
arise,’ tossing about their billowy tops, and tumbling their unwieldy
shapes in all directions—a world of wonders!—Any one, who is
much of an egotist, ought not to travel through these districts; his
vanity will not find its account in them; it will be chilled, mortified,
shrunk up: but they are a noble treat to those who feel themselves
raised in their own thoughts and in the scale of being by the
immensity of other things, and who can aggrandise and piece out
their personal insignificance by the grandeur and eternal forms of
nature! It gives one a vast idea of Buonaparte to think of him in
these situations. He alone (the Rob Roy of the scene) seemed a
match for the elements, and able to master ‘this fortress, built by
nature for herself.’ Neither impeded nor turned aside by immoveable
barriers, he smote the mountains with his iron glaive, and made them
malleable; cut roads through them; transported armies over their
ridgy steeps; and the rocks ‘nodded to him, and did him courtesies!’</p>

<p class='c000'>We arrived at St. Michelle at night-fall (after passing through beds
of ice and the infernal regions of cold), where we met with a truly
hospitable reception, with wood-floors in the English fashion, and
where they told us the King of England had stopped. This made
no sort of difference to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>We breakfasted the next day (being Sunday) at Lans-le-Bourg, where
I observed my friend the Spaniard busy with his tables, taking down the
name of the place. The landlady was a little, round, fat, good-humoured
black-eyed Italian or Savoyard, <em>saying</em> a number of good things to all
her guests, but sparing of them otherwise. We were now at the foot of
Mount Cenis, and after breakfast we set out on foot before the Diligence,
which was to follow us in half an hour. We passed a melancholy-looking
inn at the end of the town, professing to be kept by an Englishwoman;
but there appeared to be nobody about the house, English,
French, or Italian. The mistress of it (a young woman who had
married an Italian) had, in fact, died a short time before of pure chagrin
and disappointment in this solitary place, after having told her tale of
distress to every one, till it fairly wore her out. We had leisure to look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>back to the town as we proceeded, and which, with its church, stone-cottages,
and slated roofs, shrunk into a miniature-model of itself as
we continued to advance farther and higher above it. Some straggling
cottages, some vineyards planted at a great height, and another
compact and well-built village, that seemed to defy the extremity of
the seasons, were seen in the direction of the valley that we were
pursuing. Else all around were shapeless, sightless piles of hills
covered with snow, with crags or pine-trees or a foot-path peeping
out, and in the appearance of which no alteration whatever was made
by our advancing or receding. We gained on the mountain by a
broad, winding road that continually doubles, and looks down upon
the point from whence you started half an hour before. Some snow
had fallen in the morning, but it was now fine, though cloudy. We
found two of our fellow-travellers following our example, and they
soon after overtook us. They were both French. We noticed some
of the features of the scenery; and a lofty hill opposite to us being
scooped out into a bed of snow, with two ridges or promontories
projecting (something like an arm-chair) on each side. ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà!</span></i>’
said the younger and more volatile of our companions, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c’est un trône,
et le nuage est la gloire!</span></i>‘—A white cloud indeed encircled its misty
top. I complimented him on the happiness of his allusion, and said
that Madame was pleased with the exactness of the resemblance.
He then turned to the valley, and said, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un berceau</span></i>.’ This is
the height to which the imagination of a Frenchman always soars,
and it can soar no higher. Any thing that is not cast in this
obvious, common-place mould, that had been used a thousand times
before with applause, they think barbarous, and as they phrase it,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">originaire</span></i>. No farther notice was taken of the scenery, any more
than if we had been walking on the Boulevards at Paris, and my
young Frenchman talked of other things, laughed, sung, and smoked
a cigar with a gaiety and lightness of heart that I envied. ‘What has
become,’ said the elder of the Frenchmen, ‘of Monsieur l’Espagnol?
He does not easily quit his seat; he sits in one corner, never looks out,
or if you point to any object, takes no notice of it; and when you
come to the end of the stage, says—“What is the name of that place
we passed by last?” takes out his pocket-book, and makes a note of
it. “That is droll.”’ And what made it more so, it turned out
that our Spanish friend was a painter, travelling to Rome to study
the Fine Arts! All the way as we ascended, there were red posts
placed at the edge of the road, ten or twelve feet in height, to point
out the direction of the road in case of a heavy fall of snow, and with
notches cut to shew the depth of the drifts. There were also
scattered stone-hovels, erected as stations for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gens d’armes</span></i>, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>were sometimes left here for several days together after a severe
snow-storm, without being approached by a single human being.
One of these stood near the top of the mountain, and as we were tired
of the walk (which had occupied two hours) and of the uniformity
of the view, we agreed to wait here for the Diligence to overtake us.
We were cordially welcomed in by a young peasant (a soldier’s
wife) with a complexion as fresh as the winds, and an expression as
pure as the mountain-snows. The floor of this rude tenement consisted
of the solid rock; and a three-legged table stood on it, on
which were placed three earthen bowls filled with sparkling wine,
heated on a stove with sugar. The woman stood by, and did the
honours of this cheerful repast with a rustic simplicity and a pastoral
grace that might have called forth the powers of Hemskirk and
Raphael. I shall not soon forget the rich ruby colour of the wine,
as the sun shone upon it through a low glazed window that looked
out on the boundless wastes around, nor its grateful spicy smell as
we sat round it. I was complaining of the trick that had been
played by the waiter at Lyons in the taking of our places, when I
was told by the young Frenchman, that, in case I returned to Lyons,
I ought to go to the Hotel de l’Europe, or to the Hotel du Nord,
‘in which latter case he should have the honour of serving me.’ I
thanked him for his information, and we set out to finish the ascent
of Mount Cenis, which we did in another half-hour’s march. The
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traiteur</span></i> of the Hotel du Nord and I had got into a brisk theatrical
discussion on the comparative merits of Kean and Talma, he asserting
that there was something in French acting which an English
understanding could not appreciate; and I insisting loudly on bursts
of passion as the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i> of Talma, which was a language common to
human nature; that in his <cite>Œdipus</cite>, for instance, it was not a Frenchman
or an Englishman he had to represent—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais c’est un homme,
c’est Œdipe</span></i>‘—when our cautious Spaniard brushed by us, determined
to shew he could descend the mountain, if he would not ascend it on
foot. His figure was characteristic enough, his motions smart and
lively, and his dress composed of all the colours of the rainbow. He
strutted on before us in the snow, like a flamingo or some tropical
bird of variegated plumage; his dark purple cloak fluttered in the air,
his Montero cap, set a little on one side, was of fawn colour; his
waistcoat a bright scarlet, his coat a reddish brown, his trowsers a
pea-green, and his boots a perfect yellow. He saluted us with a
national politeness as he passed, and seemed bent on redeeming the
sedentary sluggishness of his character by one bold and desperate
effort of locomotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The coach shortly after overtook us. We descended a long and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>steep declivity, with the highest point of Mount Cenis on our left,
and a lake to the right, like a landing-place for geese. Between the
two was a low, white monastery, and the barrier where we had our
passports inspected, and then went forward with only two stout horses
and one rider. The snow on this side of the mountain was nearly
gone. I supposed myself for some time nearly on level ground, till
we came in view of several black chasms or steep ravines in the side
of the mountain facing us, with water oozing from it, and saw through
some <em>galleries</em>, that is, massy stone-pillars knit together by thick rails
of strong timber, guarding the road-side, a perpendicular precipice
below, and other galleries beyond, diminished in a fairy perspective,
and descending ‘with cautious haste and giddy cunning,’ and with
innumerable windings and re-duplications to an interminable depth and
distance from the height where we were. The men and horses with
carts, that were labouring up the path in the hollow below, shewed
like crows or flies. The road we had to pass was often immediately
under that we were passing, and cut from the side of what was all
but a precipice out of the solid rock by the broad, firm master-hand
that traced and executed this mighty work. The share that art has
in the scene is as appalling as the scene itself—the strong security
against danger as sublime as the danger itself. Near the turning of
one of the first galleries is a beautiful waterfall, which at this time
was frozen into a sheet of green pendant ice—a magical transformation.
Long after we continued to descend, now faster and now
slower, and came at length to a small village at the bottom of a
sweeping line of road, where the houses seemed like dove-cotes with
the mountain’s back reared like a wall behind them, and which I
thought the termination of our journey. But here the wonder and the
greatness began: for, advancing through a grove of slender trees to
another point of the road, we caught a new view of the lofty mountain
to our left. It stood in front of us, with its head in the skies, covered
with snow, and its bare sides stretching far away into a valley that
yawned at its feet, and over which we seemed suspended in mid air.
The height, the magnitude, the immovableness of the objects, the
wild contrast, the deep tones, the dance and play of the landscape
from the change of our direction and the interposition of other
striking objects, the continued recurrence of the same huge masses,
like giants following us with unseen strides, stunned the sense like a
blow, and yet gave the imagination strength to contend with a force
that mocked it. Here immeasurable columns of reddish granite
shelved from the mountain’s sides; here they were covered and
stained with furze and other shrubs; here a chalky cliff shewed a fir-grove
climbing its tall sides, and that itself looked at a distance like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>huge, branching pine-tree; beyond was a dark, projecting knoll, or
hilly promontory, that threatened to bound the perspective—but, on
drawing nearer to it, the cloudy vapour that shrouded it (as it were)
retired, and opened another vista beyond, that, in its own unfathomed
depth, and in the gradual obscurity of twilight, resembled the
uncertain gloom of the back-ground of some fine picture. At the
bottom of this valley crept a sluggish stream, and a monastery or low
castle stood upon its banks. The effect was altogether grander than
I had any conception of. It was not the idea of height or elevation
that was obtruded upon the mind and staggered it, but we seemed to
be descending into the bowels of the earth—its foundations seemed to
be laid bare to the centre; and abyss after abyss, a vast, shadowy,
interminable space, opened to receive us. We saw the building up
and frame-work of the world—its limbs, its ponderous masses, and
mighty proportions, raised stage upon stage, and we might be said to
have passed into an unknown sphere, and beyond mortal limits. As
we rode down our winding, circuitous path, our baggage, (which had
been taken off) moved on before us; a grey horse that had got loose
from the stable followed it, and as we whirled round the different
turnings in this rapid, mechanical flight, at the same rate and the
same distance from each other, there seemed something like witchcraft
in the scene and in our progress through it. The moon had risen,
and threw its gleams across the fading twilight; the snowy tops of
the mountains were blended with the clouds and stars; their sides
were shrouded in mysterious gloom, and it was not till we entered
Susa, with its fine old drawbridge and castellated walls, that we found
ourselves on <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</span></i>, or breathed common air again. At the inn
at Susa, we first perceived the difference of Italian manners; and the
next day arrived at Turin, after passing over thirty miles of the
straightest, flattest, and dullest road in the world. Here we stopped
two days to recruit our strength and look about us.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p class='c008'>My arrival at Turin was the first and only moment of intoxication I
have found in Italy. It is a city of palaces. After a change of
dress (which, at the end of a long journey, is a great luxury) I
walked out, and traversing several clean, spacious streets, came to a
promenade outside the town, from which I saw the chain of Alps we
had left behind us, rising like a range of marble pillars in the evening
sky. Monte Viso and Mount Cenis resembled two pointed cones of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>ice, shooting up above all the rest. I could distinguish the broad
and rapid Po, winding along at the other extremity of the walk,
through vineyards and meadow grounds. The trees had on that
deep sad foliage, which takes a mellower tinge from being prolonged
into the midst of winter, and which I had only seen in pictures.
A Monk was walking in a solitary grove at a little distance from the
common path. The air was soft and balmy, and I felt transported
to another climate—another earth—another sky. The winter was
suddenly changed to spring. It was as if I had to begin my life
anew. Several young Italian women were walking on the terrace, in
English dresses, and with graceful downcast looks, in which you might
fancy that you read the soul of the Decameron. It was a fine, serious
grace, equally remote from French levity and English sullenness,
but it was the last I saw of it. I have run the gauntlet of vulgar
shapes and horrid faces ever since. The women in Italy (so far as I
have seen hitherto) are detestably ugly. They are not even dark
and swarthy, but a mixture of brown and red, coarse, marked with
the small pox, with pug-features, awkward, ill-made, fierce, dirty, lazy,
neither attempting nor hoping to please. Italian beauty (if there is,
as I am credibly informed, such a thing) is retired, conventual, denied to
the common gaze. It was and it remains a dream to me, a vision of
the brain! I returned to the inn (the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pension Suisse</span></i>) in high spirits,
and made a most luxuriant dinner. We had a wild duck equal to
what we had in Paris, and the grapes were the finest I ever tasted.
Afterwards we went to the Opera, and saw a <em>ballet of action</em> (out-heroding
Herod) with all the extravagance of incessant dumb-show and
noise, the glittering of armour, the burning of castles, the clattering
of horses on and off the stage, and heroines like furies in hysterics.
Nothing at Bartholomew Fair was ever in worse taste, noisier, or
finer. It was as if a whole people had buried their understandings,
their imaginations, and their hearts in their senses; and as if the latter
were so jaded and worn out, that they required to be inflamed,
dazzled, and urged almost to a kind of frenzy-fever, to feel any thing.
The house was crowded to excess, and dark, all but the stage, which
shed a dim, ghastly light on the gilt boxes and the audience.
Milton might easily have taken his idea of Pandemonium from the
inside of an Italian Theatre, its heat, its gorgeousness, and its gloom.
We were at the back of the pit, in which there was only standing
room, and leaned against the first row of boxes, full of the Piedmontese
Nobility, who talked fast and loud in their harsh guttural dialect, in
spite of the repeated admonitions of ‘a gentle usher, Authority by
name,’ who every five seconds hissed some lady of quality and high
breeding whose voice was heard with an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> above all the rest. No
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>notice whatever was taken of the acting or the singing (which was
any thing but Italian, unless Italian at present means a bad imitation
of the French) till a comic dance attracted all eyes, and drew forth
bursts of enthusiastic approbation. I do not know the performers’
names, but a short, squat fellow (a kind of <em>pollard</em> of the green-room)
dressed in a brown linsey-woolsey doublet and hose, with round head,
round shoulders, short arms and short legs, made love to a fine <em>die-away</em>
lady, dressed up in the hoops, lappets and furbelows of the last
age, and stumped, nodded, pulled and tugged at his mistress with
laudable perseverance, and in determined opposition to the awkward,
mawkish graces of an Adonis of a rival, with flowing locks, pink
ribbons, yellow kerseymere breeches, and an insipid expression of the
utmost distress. It was an admirable grotesque and fantastic piece of
pantomime humour. The little fellow who played the Clown,
certainly entered into the part with infinite adroitness and spirit. He
merited the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">teres et rotundus</span></i> of the poet. He bounded over the stage
like a foot-ball, rolled himself up like a hedge-hog, stuck his arms in
his sides like fins, rolled his eyes in his head like bullets—and the
involuntary plaudits of the audience witnessed the success of his
efforts at once to electrify and <em>stultify</em> them! The only annoyance
I found at Turin was the number of beggars who are stuck against
the walls like fixtures, and expose their diseased, distorted limbs, with
no more remorse or feeling than if they did not belong to them,
deafening you with one wearisome cry the whole day long.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were fortunate enough to find a voiture going from Geneva to
Florence, with an English lady and her niece—I bargained for the
two remaining places for ten guineas, and the journey turned out
pleasantly, I believe, to all parties; I am sure it did so to us. We
were to be eight days on the road, and to stop two days to rest, once
at Parma, and once at Bologna, to see the pictures. Having made
this arrangement, I was proceeding over the bridge towards the
Observatory that commands a view of the town and the whole
surrounding country, and had quite forgotten that I had such a thing
as a passport to take with me. I found, however, I had no fewer
than four signatures to procure, besides the six that were already
tacked to my passport, before I could proceed, and which I had some
difficulty in obtaining in time to set out on the following morning.
The hurry I was thrown into by this circumstance prevented me from
seeing some fine Rembrandts, Spagnolettos and Caraccis, which I was
told are to be found in the Palace of Prince Carignani and elsewhere.
I received this piece of information from my friend the Spaniard,
who called on me to inquire my proposed route, and to ‘testify,’ as
he said, ‘his respect for the English character.’ Shall I own it? I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>who flout, rail at, and contemn the English, was more pleased with this
compliment paid to me in my national character, than with any I ever
received on the score of personal civility. My fellow-traveller was
for Genoa and Milan; I for Florence: but we were to meet at Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning was clear and frosty, and the sun shone bright
into the windows of the voiture, as we left Turin, and proceeded
for some miles at a gentle pace along the banks of the Po. The
road was level and excellent, and we met a number of market people
with mules and yokes of oxen. There were some hills crowned
with villas; some bits of traditional Italian scenery now and then; but
in general you would not know but that you were in England, except
from the greater clearness and lightness of the air. We breakfasted
at the first town we came to, in two separate English groups, and I
could not help being struck with the manner of our reception at an
Italian inn, which had an air of indifference, insolence, and hollow
swaggering about it, as much as to say, ‘Well, what do you think of
us Italians? Whatever you think, we care very little about the
matter!’ The French are a politer people than the Italians—the
English are honester; but I may as well postpone these comparisons
till my return. The room smoked, and the waiter insisted on having
the windows and the door open, in spite of my remonstrances to the
contrary. He flung in and out of the room as if he had a great
opinion of himself, and wished to express it by a <em>braggadocio</em> air.
The partridges, coffee, cheese and grapes, on which we breakfasted
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la fourchette</span></i>, were, however, excellent. I said so, but the acknowledgment
seemed to be considered as superfluous by our attendant,
who received five francs for his master, and one for himself, with an
air of condescending patronage. In consequence of something being
said about our passports, he relaxed in the solemnity of his deportment,
and observed that ‘he had been once near being engaged as
valet to an English gentleman, at Ostend; that he had but three
hours to procure his passport, but while he was getting it, the ship
sailed, and he lost his situation.’ Such was my first impression of
Italian inns and waiters, and I have seen nothing since materially to
alter it. They receive you with a mixture of familiarity and fierceness,
and instead of expecting any great civility from them, they
excite that sort of uncomfortable sensation as to the footing you are
upon, that you are glad to get away without meeting with some
affront. There is either a fawning sleekness, which looks like
design, or an insolence, which looks as if they had you in their
power. In Switzerland and Savoy you are waited on by women; in
Italy by men. I cannot say I like the exchange. From Turin to
Florence, only one girl entered the room, and she (not to mend the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>matter) was a very pretty one.—I was told at the office of Messrs.
Bonnafoux at Turin, that travelling to Rome by a vetturino was
highly dangerous, and that their Diligence was guarded by four
carabineers, to defend it from the banditti. I saw none, nor the
appearance of any thing that looked like a robber, except a bare-foot
friar, who suddenly sprang out of a hedge by the road-side, with a
somewhat wild and haggard appearance, which a little startled me.
Instead of finding a thief concealed behind each bush, or a Salvator
Rosa face scowling from a ruined hovel, or peeping from a jutting
crag at every turn, there is an excellent turnpike-road all the way,
three-fourths perfectly level, skirted with hedges, corn-fields, orchards
and vineyards, populous with hamlets and villages, with labourers at
work in the fields, and with crowds of peasants in gay, picturesque
attire, and with healthy, cheerful, open, but manly countenances,
passing along, either to or from the different market-towns. It was
Carnival time; and as we travelled on, we were struck with the
variety of rich dresses, red, yellow, and green, the high-plaited head-dresses
of the women, some in the shape of helmets, with pins stuck
in them like skewers, with gold crosses at their bosoms, and large
muffs on their hands, who poured from the principal towns along the
high-road, or turned off towards some village-spire in the distance,
chequering the landscape with their gaily-tinted groups. They often
turned back and laughed as we drove by them, or passed thoughtfully
on without noticing us, but assuredly showed no signs of an intention
to rob or murder us. Even in the Apennines, though the road is
rugged and desolate, it is lined with farm-houses and towns at small
distances; and there is but one house all the way that is stained by
the recollection of a tragic catastrophe. How it may be farther
south, I cannot say; but so far, the reports to alarm strangers are (to
the best of my observation and conjecture) totally unfounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had left the Alps behind us, the white tops of which we still
saw scarcely distinguishable from ridges of rolling clouds, and that
seemed to follow us like a formidable enemy, and almost enclose us in
a semicircle; and we had the Apennines in front, that, gradually
emerging from the horizon, opposed their undulating barrier to our
future progress, with shadowy shapes of danger and Covigliaijo
lurking in the midst of them. All the space between these two, for
at least 150 miles (I should suppose) is one level cultivated plain,
one continuous garden. This became more remarkably the case, as
we entered the territories of Maria-Louisa (the little States of Parma
and Placentia) when, for two whole days, we literally travelled
through an uninterrupted succession of corn-fields, vineyards and
orchards, all in the highest state of cultivation, with the hedges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>neatly clipped into a kind of trellis-work, and the vines hanging in
festoons from tree to tree, or clinging ‘with marriageable arms’ round
the branches of each regularly planted and friendly support. It was
more like passing through a number of orchard-plots or garden-grounds
in the neighbourhood of some great city (such as London) than
making a journey through a wide and extensive tract of country.
Not a common came in sight, nor a single foot of waste or indifferent
ground. It became tedious at last from the richness, the neatness,
and the uniformity; for the whole was worked up to an ideal model,
and so exactly a counterpart of itself, that it was like looking out of
a window at the same identical spot, instead of passing on to new
objects every instant. We were saturated even with beauty and
comfort, and were disposed to repeat the wish—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To-morrow to fresh fields and pastures new.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A white square villa, or better sort of farm-house, sometimes stared
on us from the end of a long, strait avenue of poplars, standing in
ostentatious, unadorned nakedness, and in a stiff, meagre, and very
singular taste. What is the cause of the predilection of the Italians
for straight lines and unsheltered walls? Is it for the sake of security
or vanity? The desire of seeing everything or of being seen by
every one? The only thing that broke the uniformity of the scene,
or gave an appearance of wretchedness or neglect to the country, was
the number of dry beds of the torrents of melted snow and ice that
came down from the mountains in the breaking up of the winter, and
that stretched their wide, comfortless, unprofitable length across these
valleys in their progress to the Adriatic. Some of them were half a
mile in breadth, and had stately bridges over them, with innumerable
arches—(the work, it seems, of Maria Louisa) some of which we
crossed over, others we rode under. We approached the first of
them by moonlight, and the effect of the long, white, glimmering,
sepulchral arches was as ghastly then as it is dreary in the day-time.
There is something almost preternatural in the sensation they excite,
particularly when your nerves have been agitated and harassed during
several days’ journey, and you are disposed to startle at everything in
a questionable shape. You do not know what to make of them.
They seem like the skeletons of bridges over the dry bones and dusty
relics of rivers. It is as if some mighty concussion of the earth had
swept away the water, and left the bridge standing in stiffened horror
over it. It is a new species of desolation, as flat, dull, disheartening,
and hopeless as can be imagined. Mr. Crabbe should travel post to
Italy on purpose to describe it, and to add it to his list of prosaic
horrors. While here, he might also try his hand upon an Italian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>vintage, and if he does not squeeze the juice and spirit out of it, and
leave nothing but the husk and stalks, I am much mistaken. As we
groped our way under the stony ribs of the first of these structures
that we came to, one of the arches within which the moonlight fell,
presented a momentary appearance of a woman in a white dress and
hood, stooping to gather stones. I wish I had the petrific pencil of
the ingenious artist above-named, that I might imbody this flitting
shadow in a permanent form.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was late on the fourth day (Saturday) before we reached Parma.
Our two black, glossy, easy-going horses were tired of the sameness
or length of the way; and our guide appeared to have forgotten it,
for we entered the capital of the Archduchy without his being aware
of it. We went to the Peacock Inn, where we were shewn into a
very fine but faded apartment, and where we stopped the whole of the
next day. Here, for the first time on our journey, we found a carpet,
which, however, stuck to the tiled floor with dirt and age. There
was a lofty bed, with a crimson silk canopy, a marble table, looking-glasses
of all sizes and in every direction,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and excellent coffee, fruit,
game, bread and wine at a moderate rate—that is to say, our supper
the first night, our breakfast, dinner, and coffee the next day, and
coffee the following morning, with lodging and fire, came to twenty-three
francs. It would have cost more than double in England in the
same circumstances. We had an exhilarating view from our window
of the street and great square. It was full of noise and bustle. The
people were standing in lounging attitudes by themselves, or talking
loud in groups, and with great animation. The expression of
character seemed to be natural and unaffected. Every one appeared
to follow the bent of his own humour and feelings (good or bad) and
I did not perceive any of that smirking grimace and varnish of
affectation and self-complacency, which glitters in the face and
manners of every Frenchman, and makes them so many enemies. If
an individual is inordinately delighted with himself, do not others
laugh at and take a dislike to him? Must it not be equally so
with a nation enamoured of itself?—The women that I saw did
not answer to my expectations. They had high shoulders, thick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>waists, and shambling feet, or that <em>crapaudeux</em> shape, which is odious
to see or think of. The men looked better, and I saw little difference
between them and the English, except a greater degree of fire
and spirit. The priests had many of them (both here and at Turin)
fine faces, with a jovial expression of good humour and good living,
or of subtle thought and painful watching, studious to keep the good
things that enriched the veins and pampered the pride of the brotherhood.
Here we saw the whole market-place kneel down as the host
passed by. Being Carnival time, high mass was celebrated at the
principal churches, and <cite>Moses in Egypt</cite> was given at the Opera in the
evening. The day before, as we entered Parma in the dusk, we saw
a procession of flambeaux at a distance, which denoted a funeral.
The processions are often joined by persons of the highest quality in
disguise, who make a practice of performing penance, or expiating
some offence by attending the obsequies of the dead. This custom
may be ridiculed as superstitious by an excess of Protestant zeal; but
the moralist will hardly blame what shews a sense of human infirmity,
and owns something ‘serious in mortality;’ and is besides freed from
the suspicion of ostentation or hypocrisy. Lord Glenallan, in ‘The
Antiquary,’ has been censured on the same principle, as an excrescence
of morbid and superannuated superstition. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit qui
mal y pense.</span></i> When human nature is no longer liable to such misfortunes,
our sympathy with them will then be superfluous—we may
dry up our tears, and stifle our sighs. In the mean time, they who
enlarge our sympathy with others, or deepen it for ourselves from
lofty, imaginary sources, are the true teachers of morality, and benefactors
of mankind, were they twenty times tools and Tories. It is
not the shutting up of hospitals, but the opening of the human heart,
that will lead to the regeneration of the world<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a>!</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at Parma I first noticed the women looking out of the
windows (not one or two stragglers, but two or three from every
house) where they hang like signs or pictures, stretching their necks
out, or confined, like children by iron bars, often with cushions to
lean upon, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">scaldalettos</span></i> dangling from their hands (another vile
custom). This seems to shew a prodigious predominance of the
<em>organ of sight</em>, or a want of something to do or to think of. In
France, the passion of the women is not to see, but to talk. In
Hogarth, you perceive some symptoms of the same prurience of the
optic nerve, and willingness to take in knowledge at the entrance
of the eyes. It certainly has a great look of ignorance, indolence,
and vulgarity. In summer time, perhaps, the practice might be
natural—in winter, the habit is quite unaccountable. I thought, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>first, it might be one of the abuses of the Carnival; but the Carnival
is over, and the windows are still lined with eyes and heads—that do
not like the trouble of putting on a cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were told we could see her Majesty at mass, (so her dutiful
subjects call the Archduchess) and we went to see the daughter of a
sovereign, the self-devoted consort of one who only lost himself by
taking upon him a degrading equality with Emperors and Kings.
We had a Cicerone with us, who led us, without ceremony, to a
place in the chapel, where we could command a full view of Maria
Louisa, and which we made use of without much reserve. She
knelt, or stood, in the middle of a small gallery, with attendants,
male and female, on each side of her. We saw her distinctly for
several minutes. She has full fair features, not handsome, but with
a mild, unassuming expression, tinged with thoughtfulness. She
appears about forty; she seemed to cast a wistful look at us, being
strangers and English people—</p>

      <div class='line'>So every one believes, that sees a Duchess!’—<span class='sc'>Old Play.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There are some not very pleasant rumours circulated of her. She
must have had something of the heroine of the Cid about her.
She married the man who had conquered her father. She is said to
have leaned on the Duke of Wellington’s arm. After that, she
might do whatever she pleased. Perhaps these stories are only
circulated to degrade her; or, perhaps, a scheme may have been laid
to degrade her in reality, by the persons nearest to her, and most
interested in, but most jealous of, her honour! We were invited to
see the cradle of the little Napoleon, which I declined; and we then
went to see the new gallery which the Archduchess has built for her
pictures, in which there is a bust of herself, by Canova. Here I saw
a number of pictures, and among others the Correggios and the
celebrated St. Jerome, which I had seen at Paris. I must have been
out of tune; for my disappointment and my consequent mortification
were extreme. I had never thought Correggio a God; but I had
attributed this to my own inexperience and want of taste, and I hoped
by this time to have ripened into that full idolatry of him expressed
by Mengs and others. Instead of which, his pictures (they stood on
the ground without frames, and in a bad light) appeared to be comparatively
mean, feeble, and affected. There is the master-hand, no
doubt, but tremulous with artificial airs—beauty and grace carried to a
pitch of quaintness and conceit—the expression of joy or woe, but
lost in a doting contemplation of its own ecstasy or agony, and after
being raised to the height of truth and nature, hurried over the brink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of refinement into effeminacy, by a craving after impossibilities, and a
wanton dalliance with the <em>ideal</em>. Correggio has painted the wreathed
smile of sweetness, but he does not stop till he has contorted it into
affectation; he has expressed the utmost distress and despondency of
soul, but it is the weakness of suffering without the strength. His
pictures are so perfect and delicate, that ‘the sense aches at them;’
and in his efforts after refinement, he has worked himself up into a
state of languid, nervous irritability, which is reflected back upon the
spectator. These remarks appeared to me applicable in their full
force to the St. Jerome, the Taking down from the Cross, and the
Martyrdom of St. Placide, in which there is an executioner with his
back turned, in a <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-scuro</span></i> of the most marvellous clearness and
beauty. In all these there is a want of manly firmness and simplicity.
He might be supposed to have touched, at some period of his progress,
on the highest point of excellence, and then to have spoiled all by a
wish to go farther, without knowing how or why. Perhaps modesty,
or an ignorance of what others had done, or of what the art could do,
was at the foundation of this, and prevented him from knowing where
to stop. Perhaps he had too refined and tender a susceptibility, or
ideas of sanctity and sweetness beyond the power of his art to
express; and in the attempt to reconcile the mechanical and <em>ideal</em>,
failed from an excess of feeling! I saw nothing else to please me,
and I was sorry I had come so far to have my faith in great names
and immortal works misgive me. I was ready to exclaim, ‘Oh
painting! I thought thee a substance, and I find thee a shadow!’
There was, however, a <cite>Crowning of the Virgin</cite>, a fresco (by
Correggio) from the Church of St. Paul, which was full of majesty,
sweetness, and grace; and in this, and the heads of boys and fawns,
in the <cite>Chase of Diana</cite>, there is a freedom and breadth of execution,
owing to the mode in which they were painted, and which makes
them seem pure emanations of the mind, without anything overdone,
finical, or little. The cupola of St. Paul’s, painted by Correggio in
fresco, is quite destroyed, or the figures flutter in idle fragments from
the walls. Most of the other pictures in this church were in a
tawdry, meretricious style. I was beginning to think that painting
was not calculated for churches, coloured surfaces not agreeing with
solid pillars and masses of architecture, and also that Italian art was
less severe, and more a puppet-show business than I had thought it.
I was not a little tired of the painted shrines and paltry images of the
Virgin at every hundred yards as we rode along. But if my thoughts
were veering to this cheerless, attenuated speculation of nothingness
and vanity, they were called back by the sight of the Farnese
Theatre—the noblest and most striking monument I have seen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the golden age of Italy. It was built by one of the Farnese family
about the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and would hold eight thousand
spectators. It is cold, empty, silent as the receptacles of the dead.
The walls, roofs, rafters, and even seats, remain perfect; but the tide
of population and of wealth, the pomp and pride of patronage and
power, seemed to have turned another way, and to have left it a
deserted pile, that would, long ere this, have mouldered into ruin and
decay, but that its original strength and vast proportions would not
suffer it—a lasting proof of the magnificence of a former age, and of
the degeneracy of this! The streets of Parma are beautiful, airy,
clean, spacious; the churches elegant; and the walls around it
picturesque and delightful. The walls and ramparts, with the
gardens and vineyards close to them, have a most romantic effect;
and we saw, on a flight of steps near one of the barriers, a group of
men, women, and children, that for expression, composition, and
colouring rivalled any thing in painting. We here also observed the
extreme clearness and brilliancy of the southern atmosphere: the line
of hills in the western horizon was distinguished from the sky by a
tint so fine that it was barely perceptible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bologna is even superior to Parma. If its streets are less stately,
its public buildings are more picturesque and varied; and its long
arcades, its porticos, and silent walks are a perpetual feast to the eye
and the imagination. At Parma (as well as Turin) you see a whole
street at once, and have a magical and imposing effect produced once
for all. At Bologna you meet with a number of surprises; new
beauties unfold themselves, a perspective is gradually prolonged, or
branches off by some retired and casual opening, winding its heedless
way—the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rus in urbe</span></i>—where leisure might be supposed to dwell with
learning. Here is the Falling Tower, and the Neptune of John of
Bologna, in the great square. Going along, we met Professor
Mezzofanti, who is said to understand thirty-eight languages, English
among the rest. He was pointed out to us as a prodigious curiosity
by our guide, (Signor Gatti) who has this pleasantry at his tongue’s
end, that ‘there is one Raphael to paint, one Mezzofanti to understand
languages, and one Signor Gatti to explain everything they
wish to know to strangers.’ We went under the guidance of this
accomplished person, and in company of our fellow-travellers, to the
Academy, and to the collection of the Marquis Zampieri. In the
last there is not a single picture worth seeing, except some old and
curious ones of Giotto and Ghirlandaio. One cannot look at these
performances (imperfect as they are, with nothing but the high
endeavour, the fixed purpose stamped on them, like the attempts of
a deformed person at grace) with sufficient veneration, when one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>considers what they must have cost their authors, or what they have
enabled others to do. If Giotto could have seen the works of
Raphael or Correggio, would he not have laughed or wept? Yet
Raphael and Correggio should have bowed the head to him, for
without those first rude beginners and dumb creators of the art, they
themselves would never have been!—What amused us here was a
sort of wild <em>Meg Merrilies</em> of a woman, in a grey coarse dress, and
with grey matted hair, that sprang out of a dungeon of a porter’s
lodge, and seizing upon Madame ——, dragged her by the arm up
the staircase, with unrestrained familiarity and delight. We thought
it was some one who presumed on old acquaintance, and was overjoyed
at seeing Madame —— a second time. It was the mere spirit
of good fellowship, and the excess of high animal spirits. No woman
in England would dream of such an extravagance, who was not mad
or drunk. She afterwards followed us about the rooms; and though
she rather slunk behind, being somewhat abashed by our evident wish
to shake her off, she still seemed to watch for an opportunity to dart
upon some one, like an animal whose fondness you cannot get rid of
by repeated repulses.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> There is a childishness and want of self-control
about the Italians, which has an appearance of folly or
craziness. We passed a group of women on the road, and though
there was something odd in their dress and manner, it was not for
some time that we discovered that they were insane persons, walking
out under the charge of keepers, from a greater degree of vacant
vivacity, or thoughtful abstraction than usual.</p>

<p class='c000'>To return. The Collection of Pictures in the Academy is worthy
of Italy and of Bologna. It is chiefly of the Bolognese school; or
in that fine, sombre, shadowy tone that seems reflected from sacred
subjects or from legendary lore, that corresponds with crucifixions
and martyrdoms, that points to skyey glories or hovers round conventual
gloom. Here is the St. Cecilia of Raphael (of which the
engraving conveys a faithful idea), several Caraccis, Domenichino’s
St. Teresa, and his St. Peter Martyr, (a respectable, not a formidable
rival of Titian’s) a Sampson, by Guido (an ill-chosen subject, finely
coloured) and the Five Patron-Saints of Bologna, by the same, a
very large, finely-painted and impressive picture, occupying the end
of the Gallery. Four out of five of the Saints are admirable old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Monkish heads (even their very cowls seem to think): the Dead
Christ above has a fine monumental effect; and the whole picture,
compared with this master’s general style, is like ‘the cathedral’s
gloom and choir,’ compared with sunny smiles and the shepherd’s
pipe upon the mountains. I left this Gallery, once more reconciled
to my favourite art. Guido also gains upon me, because I continually
see fine pictures of his. ‘By their works ye shall know them,’ is a
fair rule for judging of painters or men.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a side pavement at Bologna, Modena, and most of the
other towns in Italy, so that you do not walk, as in Paris, in continual
dread of being run over. The shops have a neat appearance, and are
well supplied with the ordinary necessaries of life, fruit, poultry,
bread, onions or garlick, cheese and sausages. The butchers’ shops
look much as they do in England. There is a technical description
of the chief towns in Italy, which those who learn the Italian
Grammar are told to get by heart—<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>Genoa la superba</em>, <em>Bologna la
dotta</em>, <em>Ravenna l’antica</em>, <em>Firense la bella</em>, <em>Roma la santa</em></span>. Some of
these I have seen, and others not; and those that I have not seen
seem to me the finest. Does not this list convey as good an idea of
these places as one can well have? It selects some one distinct
feature of them, and that the best. Words may be said, after all, to
be the finest things in the world. Things themselves are but a
lower species of words, exhibiting the grossnesses and details of
matter. Yet, if there be any country answering to the description
or idea of it, it is Italy; and to this theory, I must add, the Alps are
also a proud exception.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p class='c008'>We left Bologna on our way to Florence in the afternoon, that we
might cross the Apennines the following day. High Mass had
been celebrated at Bologna; it was a kind of gala day, and the road
was lined with flocks of country-people returning to their homes. At
the first village we came to among the hills, we saw, talking to her
companions by the road-side, the only very handsome Italian we have
yet seen. It was not the true Italian face neither, dark and oval,
but more like the face of an English peasant, with heightened grace
and animation, with sparkling eyes, white teeth, a complexion
breathing health,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>——‘And when she spake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt the pearls and rubies softly brake</div>
      <div class='line'>A silver sound, which heavenly music seem’d to make.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Our voiture was ascending a hill; and as she walked by the side of
it with elastic step, and a bloom like the suffusion of a rosy cloud, the
sight of her was doubly welcome, in this land of dingy complexions,
squat features, scowling eye-brows and round shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>We slept at ——, nine miles from Bologna, and set off early the
next morning, that we might have the whole day before us. The
moon, which had lighted on us on our way the preceding evening,
still hung over the western horizon, its yellow orb nigh dropping
behind the snowy peaks of the highest Apennines, while the sun
was rising with dazzling splendour behind a craggy steep that overhung
the frozen road we were passing over. The white tops of the
Apennines, covered with hoar-frost gleamed in the misty morning.
There was a delightful freshness and novelty in the scene. The
Apennines have not the vastness nor the unity of effect of the Alps;
but are broken up into a number of abrupt projecting points, that
crossing one another, and presenting new combinations as the traveller
shifts his position, produce, though a less sublime and imposing, a
more varied and picturesque effect. A brook brawled down the
precipice on the road-side, a pine-tree or mountain-ash hung over it,
and shewed the valley below in a more distant, airy perspective; on
the point of a rock half-way down was perched some village-spire or
ruined battlement, while hamlets and farm-houses were sheltered in
the bosom of the vale far below: a pine-forest rose on the sides
of the mountain above, or a bleak tract of brown heath or dark
morass was contrasted with the clear pearly tints of the snowy ridges
in the higher distance, above which some still loftier peak saluted the
sky, tinged with a rosy light.—Such were nearly the features of the
landscape all round, and for several miles; and though we constantly
ascended and descended a very winding road, and caught an object
now in contact with one part of the scene, now giving relief to
another, at one time at a considerable distance beneath our feet, and
soon after soaring as high above our heads, yet the elements of beauty
or of wildness being the same, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</span></i>, though constantly
changing, was as often repeated, and we at length grew tired of a
scenery that still seemed another and the same. One of our
pleasantest employments was to remark the teams of oxen and carts
that we had lately passed, winding down a declivity in our rear, or
suspended on the edge of a precipice, that on the spot we had
mistaken for level ground. We had some difficulty too with our
driver, who had talked gallantly over-night of hiring a couple of oxen
to draw us up the mountain; but when it <em>came to the push</em>, his heart
failed him, and his Swiss economy prevailed. In addition to his
habitual closeness, the windfall of the ten guineas, which was beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>his expectations, had whetted his appetite for gain, and he appeared
determined to make a good thing of his present journey. He pretended
to bargain with several of the owners, but from his beating
them down to the lowest fraction, nothing ever came of it, and when
from the thawing of the ice in the sun, the inconvenience became
serious, so that we were several times obliged to get out and walk, to
enable the horses to proceed with the carriage, he said it was too
late. The country now grew wilder, and the day gloomy. It was
three o’clock before we stopped at Pietra Mala to have our luggage
examined on entering the Tuscan States; and here we resolved to
breakfast, instead of proceeding four miles farther to Covigliaio,
where, though we did not choose to pass the night, we had proposed
to regale our waking imaginations with a thrilling recollection of the
superstitious terrors of the spot, at ease and in safety. Our reception
at Pietra Mala was frightful enough; the rooms were cold and empty,
and we were met with a vacant stare or with sullen frowns, in lieu of
any better welcome. I have since thought that these were probably
the consequence of the contempt and ill-humour shewn by other
English travellers at the desolateness of the place, and the apparent
want of accommodation; for, as the fire of brushwood was lighted,
and the eggs, bread, and coffee were brought in by degrees, and we
expressed our satisfaction in them, the cloud on the brow of our
reluctant entertainers vanished, and melted into thankful smiles.
There was still an air of mystery, of bustle, and inattention about
the house; persons of both sexes, and of every age, passed and
repassed through our sitting room to an inner chamber with looks
of anxiety and importance, and we learned at length that the
mistress of the inn had been, half an hour before, brought to bed
of a fine boy!</p>

<p class='c000'>We had now to mount the longest and steepest ascent of the
Apennines; and Jaques, who began to be alarmed at the accounts
of the state of the road, and at the increasing gloom of the weather,
by a great effort of magnanimity had a yoke of oxen put to, and afterwards
another horse, to drag us up the worst part; but as soon as he
could find an excuse he dismissed both, and we crawled and stumbled
on as before. The hills were covered with a dense cloud of sleet
and vapour driven before the blast, that wrapped us round, and hung
like a blanket or (if the reader pleases) a dark curtain over the more
distant range of mountains. On our right were high ledges of frowning
rocks, ‘cloud-clapt,’ and the summits impervious to the sight—on
our farthest left, an opening was made which showed a milder sky,
evening clouds pillowed on rocks, and a chain of lofty peaks basking
in the rays of the setting sun; between, and in the valley below, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>was nothing to be seen but mist and crag and grim desolation with the
lowering symptoms of the impending storm. We felt uncomfortable,
for the increased violence of the wind or thickening of the fog would
have presented serious obstacles to our farther progress, which became
every moment more necessary as the evening closed in—as it was, we
only saw a few yards of the road distinctly before us, which cleared
as we advanced forward; and at the side there was sometimes a
precipice, beyond which we could distinguish nothing but mist, so
that we seemed to be travelling along the edge of the world. The
feeling was more striking than agreeable. Our horses were blinded
by the mist, which drove furiously against them, and were nearly
exhausted with continued exertion. At length, when we had arrived
near the very top of the mountain, we had to cross a few yards of
very slippery ice, which became a matter of considerable doubt and
difficulty.—The horses could hardly keep their feet in straining to
move forward, and if one of them had fallen and been hurt, the
accident might have detained us on the middle of the mountain, without
any aid near, or made it so late that the descent on the other side
would have been dangerous. Luckily, a desperate effort succeeded,
and we gained the summit of the hill without accident. We had still
some miles to go, and we descended rapidly down on the other side,
congratulating ourselves that we had daylight to distinguish the road
from the abyss that often skirted it. About half-way down we
emerged, to our great delight, from the mist (or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brouillard</span></i>, as it is
called) that had hitherto enveloped us, and the valley opened at our
feet in dim but welcome perspective. We proceeded more leisurely
on to La Maschere, having escaped the dangers threatened us from
precipices and robbers, and drove into a spacious covered court-yard
belonging to the inn, where we were safely housed like a flock of
sheep folded for the night. The inn at La Maschere is, like many
of the inns in Italy, a set of wide dilapidated halls, without furniture,
but with quantities of old and bad pictures, portraits or histories.
The people (the attendants here were women) were obliging and
good-humoured, though we could procure neither eggs nor milk with
our coffee, but were compelled to have it <em>black</em>. We were put into
a sitting-room with three beds in it without curtains, as they had no
other with a fire-place disengaged, and which, with the coverlids like
horse-cloths, and the strong smell of the leaves of Indian corn with
which they were stuffed, brought to one’s mind the idea of a three-stalled
stable. We were refreshed, however, for we slept securely;
and we entered upon the last stage betimes the following day, less
exhausted than we had been by the first. We had left the unqualified
desolation and unbroken irregularity of the Apennines behind us; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>we were still occasionally treated with a rocky cliff, a pine-grove, a
mountain-torrent; while there was no end of sloping hills with old
ruins or modern villas upon them, of farm-houses built in the Tuscan
taste, of gliding streams with bridges over them, of meadow-grounds,
and thick plantations of olives and cypresses by the road side.</p>

<p class='c000'>After being gratified for some hours with the cultivated beauty of
the scene (rendered more striking by contrast with our late perils),
we came to the brow of the hill overlooking Florence, which lay
under us, a scene of enchantment, a city planted in a garden, and
resembling a rich and varied suburb. The whole presented a brilliant
amphitheatre of hill and vale, of buildings, groves, and terraces. The
circling heights were crowned with sparkling villas; the varying
landscape, above or below, waved in an endless succession of olive-grounds.
The olive is not unlike the common willow in shape or
colour, and being still in leaf, gave to the middle of winter the appearance
of a grey summer. In the midst, the Duomo and other churches
raised their heads; vineyards and olive-grounds climbed the hills
opposite till they joined a snowy ridge of Apennines rising above the
top of Fesole; one plantation or row of trees after another fringed
the ground, like rich lace; though you saw it not, there flowed the
Arno; every thing was on the noblest scale, yet finished in the
minutest part—the perfection of nature and of art, populous, splendid,
full of life, yet simple, airy, embowered. Florence in itself is inferior
to Bologna, and some other towns; but the view of it and of the
immediate neighbourhood is superior to any I have seen. It is,
indeed, quite delicious, and presents an endless variety of enchanting
walks. It is not merely the number or the exquisiteness or admirable
combination of the objects, their forms or colour, but every spot is
rich in associations at once the most classical and romantic. From
my friend L. H.’s house at Moiano, you see at one view the village
of Setiniano, belonging to Michael Angelo’s family, the house in
which Machiavel lived, and that where Boccaccio wrote, two ruined
castles, in which the rival families of the Gerardeschi and the ——
carried on the most deadly strife, and which seem as though they
might still rear their mouldering heads against each other; and not
far from this the <cite>Valley of Ladies</cite> (the scene of <cite>The Decameron</cite>), and
Fesole, with the mountains of Perugia beyond. With a view like
this, one may think one’s sight ‘enriched,’ in Burns’s phrase. On
the ascent towards Fesole is the house where Galileo lived, and
where he was imprisoned after his release from the Inquisition, at the
time Milton saw him.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> In the town itself are Michael Angelo’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>house, the Baptistery, the gates of which he thought worthy to be
the gates of Paradise, the Duomo, older than St. Peter’s, the ancient
Palace of the Medici family, the Palace Pitti, and here also stands
the statue that ‘enchants the world.’ The view along the Arno is
certainly delightful, though somewhat confined, and the bridges over
it grotesque and old, but beautiful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The streets of Florence are paved entirely with flag-stones, and it
has an odd effect at first to see the horses and carriages drive over
them. You get out of their way, however, more easily than in Paris,
from not having the slipperiness of the stones to contend with. The
streets get dirty after a slight shower, and the next day you have
clouds of dust again. Many of the narrower streets are like lofty
paved courts, cut through a solid quarry of stone. In general, the
public buildings are old, and striking chiefly from their massiness and
the quaintness of the style and ornaments. Florence is like a town
that has survived itself. It is distinguished by the remains of early
and rude grandeur; it is left where it was three hundred years ago.
Its history does not seem brought down to the present period. On
entering it, you may imagine yourself enclosed in a besieged town; if
you turn down any of its inferior streets, you feel as if you might
meet the plague still lurking there. Even the walks out of the town
are mostly between high stone-walls, which are a bad substitute for
hedges. The best and most fashionable is that along the river-side;
and the gay dresses and glittering equipages passing under the tall
cedar-trees, and with the purple hills in the distance for a back-ground,
produce a delightful effect, particularly when seen from the opposite
side of the river. The carriages in Florence are numerous and
splendid, and rival those in London. Lord Burghersh’s, with its
six horses and tall footmen in fine liveries, is only distinguishable from
the rest by the little child in a blue velvet hat and coat, looking out at
the window. The Corso on Sundays, and on other high days and
holidays, is filled with a double row of open carriages, like the ring
in Hyde-Park, moving slowly in opposite directions, in which you
see the flower of the Florentine nobility. I see no difference between
them and the English, except that they are darker and graver. It
was Carnival-time when we came, and the town presented something
of the same scene that London does at Bartholomew-Fair. The
streets were crowded with people, half of them masked. But what
soon took off from the gaiety of the motley assemblage was, that you
found that the masks were all the same. There was great observance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>of the season, and great good-will to be pleased, but a dearth of wit
and invention. Not merely the uniformity of the masks grew tiresome,
but the seeing an inflexible pasteboard countenance moving
about upon a living body (and without any thing quaint or extravagant
in the actions of the person to justify a resort to so grotesque a
disguise) shocked by its unmeaning incongruity. May-day in London
is a favourable version of the Carnival here. The finery of the
chimney-sweepers is an agreeable and intelligible contrast to their
usual squalidness. Their three days’ license has spirit, noise, and
mirth in it; whereas the dull eccentricity and mechanical antics of
the Carnival are drawled out till they are merged without any
violent effort in the solemn farce of Lent. It had been a fine
season this year, and it is said that the difference between a
good season and a bad one to the trades-people is so great, that it
pays the rent of their houses. No one is allowed to wear a
mask, after Lent commences, and the priests never mask. There
is no need that they should. There is no ringing of bells here
as with us (triple bob-majors have not sent their cheering sound
into the heart of Italy); but during the whole ten days or fortnight
that the Carnival continues, there is a noise and jangling of
bells, such as is made by the idle boys in a country town on
our Shrove Tuesday. We could not tell exactly what to make
of the striking of the clocks at first: at eight they struck two; at
twelve six. We thought they were put back to prevent the note
of time, or were thrown into confusion to accord with the license of
the occasion. A day or two cleared up the mystery, and we found
that the clocks here (at least those in our immediate neighbourhood)
counted the hours by sixes, instead of going on to twelve—which
method, when you are acquainted with it, saves time and patience
in telling the hour. I have only heard of two masks that seemed to
have any point or humour in them; and one of these was not a
mask, but a person who went about with his face uncovered, but
keeping it, in spite of every thing he saw or heard, in the same
unmoved position as if it were a mask. The other was a person
so oddly disguised, that you did not know what to make of him,
whether he were man or woman, beast or bird, and who, pretending to
be equally at a loss himself, went about asking every one, if they could
tell him what he was? A Neapolitan nobleman who was formerly
in England (Count Acetto), carried the liberty of masking too far.
He went to the English Ambassador’s in the disguise of a monk,
carrying a bundle of wood at his back, with a woman’s legs peeping
out, and written on a large label, ‘Provision for the Convent.’ The
clergy, it is said, interfered, and he has been exiled to Lucca. Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Burghersh remonstrated loudly at this step, as a violation of the
dignity and privileges of Ambassadors. The offence, whatever it
was, was committed at his house, and the English Ambassador’s
house is supposed to be in England—the <em>absentees</em> here were alarmed,
for at this rate strangers might be sent out of the town at an
hour’s notice for a jest. The Count called in person on the Grand
Duke, who shook him kindly by the hand—the Countess Rinuccini
demanded an interview with the Grand Duchess—but the clergy
must be respected, and the Count has been sent away. There has
been a good deal of talk and bustle about it—ask the opinion of a dry
Scotchman, who judges of every thing by precedent, and he will tell
you, ‘It is just like our <cite>Alien Bill</cite>.’ It is a rule here that a priest
is never brought upon the stage. How do they contrive to act our
<cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>? Molière’s <cite>Tartuffe</cite> is not a priest, but merely a
saint. When this play was forbidden to be acted a second time by
the Archbishop of Paris, and the audience loudly demanded the
reason of its being withdrawn, Molière came forward and said,
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur l’Archevêque ne veut pas qu’il soit joué?</span></i>’ This was a
hundred and fifty years ago. With so much wit and sense in the
world one wonders that there are any Tartuffes left in it; but for the
last hundred and fifty years, it must be confessed, they have had but
an uneasy life of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lent is not kept here very strictly. The streets, however, have
rather a ‘fishy fume’ in consequence of it; and, generally speaking,
the use of garlick, tobacco, cloves and oil gives a medicated taint to
the air. The number of pilgrims to Rome, at this season, is
diminished from 80 or 90,000 a century ago, to a few hundreds at
present. We passed two on the road, with their staff and scrip and
motley attire. I did not look at them with any particle of respect.
The impression was, that they were either knaves or fools. The
farther they come on this errand, the more you have a right to
suspect their motives, not that I by any means suppose these are
always bad—but those who signalise their zeal by such long marches
obtain not only absolution for the past, but extraordinary indulgence
for the future, so that if a person meditate any baseness or mischief,
a pilgrimage to Rome is his high road to it. The Popish religion is
a convenient cloak for crime, an embroidered robe for virtue. It
makes the essence of good and ill to depend on rewards and punishments,
and places these in the hands of the priests, for the honour of
God and the welfare of the church. Their path to Heaven is a kind
of gallery directly over the path to Hell; or, rather, it is the same
road, only that at the end of it you kneel down, lift up your hands
and eyes, and say you have gone wrong, and you are admitted into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>the right-hand gate, instead of the left-hand one. Hell is said, in
the strong language of controversial divinity, to be ‘paved with good
intentions.’ Heaven, according to some fanatical creeds, is ‘paved
with mock-professions.’ Devotees and proselytes are passed on like
wretched paupers, with false certificates of merit, by hypocrites and
bigots, who consider submission to their opinions and power as more
than equivalent to a conformity to the dictates of reason or the will
of God. All this is charged with being a great piece of cant and
imposture: it is not more so than human nature itself. Popery is
said to be a <em>make-believe</em> religion: man is a <em>make-believe</em> animal—he
is never so truly himself as when he is acting a part; he is ever at war
with himself—his theory with his practice—what he would be (and
therefore pretends to be) with what he is; and Popery is an
admirable receipt to reconcile his higher and his lower nature in
a beautiful <em>equivoque</em> or <em>double-entendre</em> of forms and mysteries,—the
palpableness of sense with the dim abstractions of faith, the indulgence
of passion with the atonement of confession and abject
repentance when the fit is over, the debasement of the actual with
the elevation of the ideal part of man’s nature, the Pagan with the
Christian religion; to substitute lip-service, genuflections, adoration
of images, counting of beads, repeating of <em>Aves</em> for useful works
or pure intentions, and to get rid at once of all moral obligation, of
all self-control and self-respect, by the proxy of maudlin superstition,
by a slavish submission to priests and saints, by prostrating ourselves
before them, and entreating them to take our sins and weaknesses
upon them, and supply us with a saving grace (at the expence of
a routine of empty forms and words) out of the abundance of
their merits and imputed righteousness. This religion suits the
pride and weakness of man’s intellect, the indolence of his
will, the cowardliness of his fears, the vanity of his hopes, his
disposition to reap the profits of a good thing and leave the trouble
to others, the magnificence of his pretensions with the meanness
of his performance, the pampering of his passions, the stifling
of his remorse, the making sure of this world and the next, the
saving of his soul and the comforting of his body. It is adapted
equally to kings and people—to those who love power or dread it—who
look up to others as Gods, or who would trample them under
their feet as reptiles—to the devotees of show and sound, or the
visionary and gloomy recluse—to the hypocrite and bigot—to saints
or sinners—to fools or knaves—to men, women, and children. In
short, its success is owing to this, that it is a mixture of bitter sweets—that
it is a remedy that soothes the disease it affects to cure—that
it is not an antidote, but a vent for the peccant humours, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>follies and vices of mankind, with a salvo in favour of appearances,
a reserve of loftier aspirations (whenever it is convenient to resort to
them), and a formal recognition of certain general principles, as a
courtesy of speech, or a compromise between the understanding and
the passions! <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne tulit punctum.</span></i> There is nothing to be said
against it, but that it is contrary to reason and common sense; and
even were they to prevail over it, some other absurdity would start
up in its stead, not less mischievous but less amusing; for man cannot
exist long without having scope given to his propensity to the
marvellous and contradictory. Methodism with us is only a bastard
kind of Popery, with which the rabble are intoxicated; and to
which even the mistresses of Kings might resort (but for its
vulgarity) to repair faded charms with divine graces, to exchange
the sighs of passion for the tears of a no less luxurious repentance,
and to exert one more act of power by making proselytes of their
royal paramours!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Popish calendar is but a transposition of the Pagan Mythology.
The images, shrines, and pictures of the Virgin Mary, that we meet
at the corner of every street or turning of a road, are not of modern
date, but coeval with the old Greek and Roman superstitions.
There were the same shrines and images formerly dedicated to Flora,
or Ceres, or Pomona, and the flowers and the urn still remain. The
oaths of the common people are to this day more Heathen than
Catholic. They swear ‘By the countenance of Bacchus’—‘By the
heart of Diana.’ A knavish innkeeper, if you complain of the badness
of his wine, swears ‘<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Per Bacco e per Dio</span></i>,’ ‘By Bacchus and by
God, that it is good!’ I wonder when the change in the forms of
image-worship took place in the old Roman States, and what effect it
had. I used formerly to wonder how or when the people in the
mountains of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and who live in solitudes
to which the town of Keswick is <em>the polite world</em>, and its lake ‘the
Leman-Lake,’ first passed from Popery to Protestantism, what
difference it made in them at the time, or has done to the present
day? The answer to this question would go a good way to shew
how little the common people know of or care for any theory of
religion, considered merely as such. Mr. Southey is on the spot, and
might do something towards a solution of the difficulty!</p>

<p class='c000'>Customs come round. I was surprised to find, at the Hotel of the
<em>Four Nations</em>, where we stopped the two first days, that we could
have a pudding for dinner (a thing that is not to be had in all France);
and I concluded this was a luxury which the Italians had been compelled
to adopt from the influx of the English, and the loudness of
their demands for comfort. I understand it is more probable that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>this dish is indigenous rather than naturalized; and that we got it
from them in the time of Queen Elizabeth, when our intercourse with
Italy was more frequent than it was with France. We might have
remained at the <em>Four Nations</em>; for eighteen francs a day, living in
a very sumptuous manner; but we have removed to apartments fitted
up in the English fashion, for ten piastres (two guineas) a month,
and where the whole of our expenses for boiled and roast, with
English cups and saucers and steamed potatoes, does not come to
thirty shillings a week. We have every English comfort with
clearer air and a finer country. It was exceedingly cold when we first
came, and we felt it the more from impatience and disappointment.
From the thinness of the air there was a feeling of nakedness about
you; you seemed as if placed in an empty receiver. Not a particle
of warmth or feeling was left in your whole body: it was just as if
the spirit of cold had penetrated every part; one might be said to be
<em>vitrified</em>. It is now milder (Feb. 23), and like April weather in
England. There is a balmy lightness and vernal freshness in the
air. Might I once more see the coming on of Spring as erst in the
spring-time of my life, it would be here! I cannot speak to the
subject of manners in this place, except as to outward appearances,
which are the same as in a country town in England. Judging by
the fashionable test on this subject, they must be very bad and
desperate indeed; for none of that stream of prostitution flows down
the streets, that in the British metropolis is supposed to purify the
morality of private families, and to carry off every taint of grossness or
licentiousness from the female heart. Cecisbeism still prevails here,
less in the upper, more in the lower classes; and may serve as a subject
for the English to vent their spleen and outrageous love of virtue upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fesole, that makes so striking a point of view near Florence, was
one of the twelve old Tuscan cities that existed before the time of
the Romans, and afterwards in a state of hostility to them. It is
supposed to have been originally founded by a Greek colony that
came over with Cecrops, and others go back to the time of Japhet or
to Hesiod’s theogony. Florence was not founded till long after. It
is said to have occupied the three conically-shaped hills which stand
about three miles from Florence. Here was fought the last great
battle between Catiline and the Senate; and here the Romans
besieged and starved to death an army of the Goths. It is a place
of the highest antiquity and renown, but it does not bear the stamp
of anything extraordinary upon its face. You stand upon a bleak,
rocky hill, without suspecting it to have been the centre of a thronged
population, the seat of battles and of mighty events in eldest times.
So you pass through cities and stately palaces, and cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>persuaded that, one day, no trace of them will be left. Italy is not
favourable to the look of age or of length of time. The ravages of
the climate are less fatal; the oldest places seem rather deserted than
mouldering into ruin, and the youth and beauty of surrounding
objects mixes itself up even with the traces of devastation and decay.
The monuments of antiquity appear to enjoy a green old age in the
midst of the smiling productions of modern civilization. The gloom
of the seasons does not at any rate add its weight to the gloom and
antiquity. It was in Italy, I believe, that Milton had the spirit and
buoyancy of imagination to write his Latin sonnet on the Platonic
idea of the archetype of the world, where he describes the shadowy
cave in which ‘dwelt Eternity’ (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">otiosa eternitas</span></i>), and ridicules the
apprehension that Nature could ever grow old, or ‘shake her starry
head with palsy.’ It has been well observed, that there is more of
the germ of Paradise Lost in the author’s early Latin poems, than in
his early English ones, which are in a strain rather playful and
tender, than stately or sublime. It is said that several of Milton’s
Poems, which he wrote at this period, are preserved in manuscript in
the libraries in Florence; but it is probable that if so, they are no
more than duplicates of those already known, which he gave to
friends. His reputation here was high, and delightful to think of;
and a volume was dedicated to him by Malatesta, a poet of the day,
and a friend of Redi—‘To the ingenuous and learned young Englishman,
John Milton.’ When one thinks of the poor figure which our
countrymen often make abroad, and also of the supposed reserved habits
and puritanical sourness of our great English Epic Poet, one is a little
in pain for his reception among foreigners and surprised at his success,
for which, perhaps, his other accomplishments (as his skill in music)
and his personal advantages, may, in some measure, account. There
is another consideration to be added, which is, that Milton did not
labour under the disadvantage of addressing foreigners in their native
tongue, but conversed with them on equal terms in Latin. That was
surely the polite and enviable age of letters, when the learned spoke a
common and well-known tongue, instead of petty, huckstering, Gothic
dialects of different nations! Now, every one who is not a Frenchman,
or who does not gabble French, is no better than a stammerer
or a changeling out of his own country. I do not complain of this
as a very great grievance; but it certainly prevents those far-famed
meetings between learned men of different nations, which are recorded
in history, as of Sir Thomas More with Erasmus, and of Milton with
the philosophers and poets of Italy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>So Dante makes one of his heroes exclaim. It is pleasant to hear
or speak one’s native tongue when abroad; but possibly the language
of that higher and adopted country, which was familiar to the scholar
of former times, sounded even sweeter to the ear of friendship or of
genius.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p class='c008'>The first thing you do when you get to a town abroad is to go to the
Post-office in expectation of letters, which you are sure not to receive
exactly in proportion as you are anxious to have them. Friends at
a distance have you at a disadvantage; and they let you know it, if
they will let you know nothing else. There is in this a love of
power or of contradiction, and at the same time a want of imagination.
They cannot change places with you, or suppose how you
can be so much at a loss about what is so obvious to them. It
seems putting them to unnecessary trouble to transmit a self-evident
truth (which it is upon the spot) a thousand miles (where it becomes
a discovery). You have this comfort, however, under the delay of
letters, that they have no bad news to send you, or you would hear
of it in an instant.</p>

<p class='c000'>When you are disappointed of your letters at the post-office at
Florence, you turn round, and find yourself in the square of the
Grand Duke, with the old Palace opposite to you, and a number
of colossal statues, bleached in the open air, in front of it. They
seem a species of huge stone-masonry. What is your surprise to
learn, that they are the Hercules of Bandinello, and the David of
Michael Angelo! Not far from these, is the Perseus of Benvenuto
Cellini, which he makes such a <em>fuss</em> about in his Life.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a> It is of
bronze. After a great deal of cabal, before he was employed on
this work, and great hostility and disagreeable obstacles thrown in
his way in the progress of it, he at length finished the mould, and
prepared to cast the figure. He found that the copper which he
had at first thrown in did not work kindly. After one or two
visits to the furnace, he grew impatient, and seizing on all the lead,
iron, and brass he could lay his hands on in the house, threw it
<em>pell-mell</em>, and in a fit of desperation, into the melting mass, and
retired to wait the result. After passing an hour in the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>agitation, he returned; and inspecting the cast, to his extreme joy
discovered it to be smooth and perfect, without a flaw in any part,
except a dint in the heel. He then sat down to enjoy his triumph
over his enemies, and to devour a cold chicken (which he had
provided for his supper) with vast composure and relish. It is a
pity that a work produced under such auspicious circumstances does
not altogether answer the romantic expectations formed of it. There
is something petty and forced about it; and it smells of the goldsmith’s
and jeweller’s shop. I would rather see the large silver
vase, richly embossed by him with groups of flowers and figures,
which was ordered by the Pope and placed under his table for the
Cardinals and other guests to throw their bones into, instead of
throwing them on the floor for the dogs to pick up, as had hitherto
been the custom—a fine proof of the mingled barbarism and refinement
of those days.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Benvenuto was a character and a genius, and
more of a character than of a genius; for, after all, the greatest
geniuses are ‘men of no mark or likelihood.’ Their strongest
impulses are not personal, but pass out of themselves into the
universe; nor do they waste their energies upon their private whims
and perverse peculiarities. In Bandinello one does not look for
much; he was never much esteemed, and is made a butt of by
Benvenuto Cellini. But what shall we say to a <em>commonplace</em> or
barbarous piece of work by Michael Angelo? The David is as if
a large mass of solid marble fell upon one’s head, to crush one’s
faith in great names. It looks like an awkward overgrown actor
at one of our minor theatres, without his clothes: the head is too
big for the body, and it has a helpless expression of distress. The
Bacchus in the Gallery, by the same artist, is no better. It is <em>potbellied</em>,
lank, and with a sickly, mawkish aspect. Both these statues
were, it is true, done when he was very young; and the latter, when
finished, he buried underground, and had it dug up as an antique,
and when it was pronounced by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">virtuosi</span></i> of the day to be superior
to any thing in modern art, he produced the arm (which he had
broken off), and claimed it as his own, to the confusion of his
adversaries. Such is the story; and under the safeguard of this
tradition, it has passed, criticism-proof. There are two pictures
here attributed to this great artist; one in the Gallery, and another
in the Palace Pitti, of <cite>The Fates</cite>, which are three meagre, dry,
mean-looking old women. I shall not return to this subject till
I get to the Vatican, and then I hope to tell a different story.
Nothing more casts one down than to find an utter disproportion
between the reality and one’s previous conceptions in a case of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>kind, when one has been brooding all one’s life over an idea of
greatness. If one could sneak off with one’s disappointment in one’s
pocket, and say nothing about it, or whisper it to the reeds, or bury
it in a hole, or throw it into the river (Arno), where no one would
fish it up, it would not signify; but to be obliged to note it in one’s
common-place book, and publish it to all the world, ‘tis villainous!
It is well one can turn from disagreeable thoughts like these to a
landscape of Titian’s (the Holy Family at the Pitti Palace). A
green bank in the fore-ground presents a pastoral scene of sheep and
cattle reposing; then you have the deep green of the middle distance,
then the blue-topped hills, and the golden sky beyond, with the red
branches of an autumn wood rising into it; and in the faces of the
bending group you see the tints of the evening sky reflected, and the
freshness of the landscape breathed on their features. The depth and
harmony of colouring in natural objects, refined in passing through
the painter’s mind, mellowed by the hand of time, has acquired the
softness and shadowy brilliancy of a dream, and while you gaze at it,
you seem to be entranced! But to take things somewhat more in
order.—</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the striking things in the Gallery at Florence (given to
the City by one of the Medici Family) is the Collection of Antique
Busts. The Statues of Gods are the poetry of the art of that period.
The busts of men and women handed down to us are the history of
the species. You see the busts of Vitellius (whose throat seems
bursting with ‘the jowl’ and a dish of lampreys), Galba, Trajan,
Augustus, Julia, Faustina, Messalina; and you ask, were there real
beings like these existing two thousand years ago? It is an extension
of the idea of humanity; and ‘even in death there is animation
too.’ History is vague and shadowy, but sculpture gives life and
body to it; the names and letters in time-worn books start up real
people in marble, and you no longer doubt their identity with the
present race. Nature produced forms then as perfect as she does
now.—Forsyth and others have endeavoured to invalidate the authenticity
of these busts, and to shew that few of them can be traced with
certainty to the persons whose names they bear. That with me is
not the question. The interesting point is not to know <em>who</em> they
were, but <em>that</em> they were. There is no doubt that they are busts of
people living two thousand years ago, and that is all that my moral
demands. As to individual character, it would be as well sometimes
to find it involved in obscurity; for some of the persons are better
looking than for the truth of physiognomy they ought to be. Nero
is as handsome a gentleman as his eulogists could wish him to be.
The truth is, that what pleases me in these busts and others of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>same kind that I have seen is, that they very much resemble English
people of sense and education in the present day, only with more
regular features. They are grave, thoughtful, unaffected. There
is not a face among them that you could mistake for a French face.
These fine old heads, in short, confirm one in the idea of general
humanity: French faces stagger one’s faith in the species!</p>

<p class='c000'>There are two long galleries enriched with busts and statues of the
most interesting description, with a series of productions of the early
Florentine school, the Flying Mercury of John of Bologna, &amp;c.; and
in a room near the centre (called the Tribune) stands the Venus of
Medici, with some other statues and pictures not unworthy to do her
homage. I do not know what to say of the Venus, nor is it
necessary to say much where all the world have already formed an
opinion for themselves; yet, perhaps, this opinion, which seems the
most universal, is the least so, and the opinion of all the world means
that of no one individual in it. The end of criticism, however, is
rather to direct attention to objects of taste, than to dictate to it.
Besides, one has seen the Venus so often and in so many shapes, that
custom has blinded one equally to its merits or defects. Instead of
giving an opinion, one is disposed to turn round and ask, ‘What do
<em>you</em> think of it?’ It is like a passage in the ‘Elegant Extracts,’
which one has read and admired, till one does not know what to
make of it, or how to affix any ideas to the words: beauty and
sweetness end in an unmeaning commonplace! If I might, notwithstanding,
hazard a hypercriticism, I should say, that it is a little too
much like an exquisite marble doll. I should conjecture (for it is
only conjecture where familiarity has neutralized the capacity of
judging) that there is a want of sentiment, of character, a balance
of pretensions as well as of attitude, a good deal of insipidity, and an
over-gentility. There is no expression of mental refinement, nor
much of voluptuous blandishment. There is great softness, sweetness,
symmetry, and timid grace—a faultless tameness, a negative perfection.
The Apollo Belvidere is positively bad, a theatrical coxcomb,
and ill-made; I mean compared with the Theseus. The great
objection to the Venus is, that the form has not the true feminine
proportions; it is not sufficiently large in the lower limbs, but tapers
too much to a point, so that it wants firmness and a sort of indolent
repose (the proper attribute of woman), and seems as if the least
thing would overset it. In a word, the Venus is a very beautiful
toy, but not the Goddess of Love, or even of Beauty. It is not the
statue Pygmalion fell in love with; nor did any man ever wish or
fancy his mistress to be like it. There is something beyond it, both
in imagination and in nature. Neither have we a firm faith in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>identity of the Goddess; it is a nice point, whether any such form
ever existed. Now let us say what we will of the <em>ideal</em>, it ought,
when embodied to the senses, to bear the stamp of the most absolute
reality, for it is only an image taken from nature, with every thing
omitted that might contradict or disturb its uniformity. The Venus
is not a poetical and abstract personification of certain qualities; but
an individual model, that has been altered and tampered with. It
would have had a better effect if executed in ivory, with gold sandals
and bracelets, like that of Phidias (mentioned by Pliny), to define
its pretensions as belonging to the class of ornamental art; for it
neither carries the mind into the regions of ancient mythology, nor
of ancient poetry, nor rises to an equality of style with modern
poetry or painting. Raphael has figures of far greater grace, both
mental and bodily. The Apollo of Medicis, which is in the same
room, is a very delightful specimen of Grecian art; but it has the
fault of being of that equivocal size (I believe called <em>small-life</em>) which
looks like diminutive nature, not nature diminished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Raphael’s Fornarina (which is also in this highly-embellished
cabinet of art) faces the Venus, and is a downright, point-blank
contrast to it. Assuredly no charge can be brought against it of
<em>mimmini-piminee</em> affectation or shrinking delicacy. It is robust, full
to bursting, coarse, luxurious, hardened, but wrought up to an infinite
degree of exactness and beauty in the details. It is the perfection
of vulgarity and refinement together. The Fornarina is a bouncing,
buxom, sullen, saucy baker’s daughter—but painted, idolized, immortalized
by Raphael! Nothing can be more homely and repulsive
than the original; you see her bosom swelling like the dough rising
in the oven; the tightness of her skin puts you in mind of Trim’s
story of the sausage-maker’s wife—nothing can be much more
enchanting than the picture—than the care and delight with which
the artist has seized the lurking glances of the eye, curved the
corners of the mouth, smoothed the forehead, dimpled the chin,
rounded the neck, till by innumerable delicate touches, and the
‘labour of love,’ he has converted a coarse, rude mass into a miracle
of art. Raphael, in the height of his devotion, and as it were to
insinuate that nothing could be too fine for this idol of his fancy
(as Rousseau prided himself in writing the letters of Julia on the
finest paper with gilt edges) has painted the chain on the Fornarina’s
neck with actual gold-leaf. Titian would never have thought of such
a thing; he could not have been guilty of such a solecism in painting,
as to introduce a solid substance without shadow. Highly as
Raphael has laboured this portrait, it still shows his inferiority to
Titian in the imitative part of painting. The colour on the cheeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of the Fornarina seems laid on the skin; in the girl by Titian at the
Pitti Palace, it is seen through it. The one appears tanned by the
sun; the other to have been out in the air, or is like a flower ‘just
washed in the dew.’ Again, the surface of the flesh in Raphael is
so smooth, that you are tempted to touch it: in Titian, it retires
from the touch into a shadowy recess. There is here a duplicate
(varied) of his <cite>Mistress at her Toilette</cite> (to be seen in the Louvre),
dressed in a loose night-robe, and with the bosom nearly bare. It is
very carefully finished, and is a rich study of colouring, expression,
and natural grace. Of the Titian Venus (with her gouvernante and
chest of clothes in the background) I cannot say much. It is very
like the common print. The Endymion by Guercino has a divine
character of pensive softness, and youthful, manly grace, and the
impression made by the picture answers to that made by the fable—an
excellent thing in history! It is one of the finest pictures in
Florence. I should never have done if I were to go into the details.
I can only mention a few of the principal. Near the Fornarina is
the Young St. John in the Wilderness, by Raphael; it is very dark,
very hard, and very fine, like an admirable carving in wood. He
has here also two Holy Families, full of playful sweetness and mild
repose. There are also two by Correggio of the same subject, and a
fine and bold study of the Head of a Boy. There is a spirit of joy
and laughing grace contained in this head, as the juice of wine is in
the grape. Correggio had a prodigious raciness and gusto, when he
did not fritter them away by false refinement and a sort of fastidious
hypercriticism upon himself. His sketches, I suspect, are better
than his finished works. One of the Holy Families here is the very
acme of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affettuoso</span></i> and Della Cruscan style of painting. The
figure of the Madonna is like a studiously-involved period or turn
upon words: the infant Christ on the ground is a diminutive appellation,
a prettiness, a fairy-fancy. Certainly, it bears no proportion to
the Mother, whose hands are bent back over it with admiration and
delight, till grace becomes a <em>cramp</em>, and her eye-lids droop and quiver
over the fluttering object of her ‘strange child-worship,’ almost as if
they were moved by metallic tractors. The other Madonna is perfectly
free from any taint of affectation. It is a plain rustic beauty,
innocent, interesting, simple, without one contortion of body or of
mind. It is sweetly painted. The Child is also a pure study after
nature: the blood is tingling in his veins, and his face has an admirable
expression of careless infantine impatience. The old Man at
the side is a master-piece, with all this painter’s knowledge of foreshortening,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-scuro</span></i>, the management of drapery, &amp;c. Herodias’s
Daughter, by Luini, is an elaborate and successful imitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Leonardo da Vinci. The Medusa’s Head of the latter is hardly,
I think, so fine as Barry’s description of it. It has not quite the
watery languor—the dim obscurity. The eyes of the female are too
much like the eyes of the snakes, red, crusted, and edgy. I shall
only notice one picture more in this collection—the Last Judgment,
by Bronzino. It has vast merit in the drawing and expression, but
its most remarkable quality is the amazing relief without any perceivable
shadow, and the utmost clearness with the smallest possible
variety of tint. It looks like a Mosaic painting. The specimens of
the Dutch and other foreign schools here are upon a small scale, and
of inferior value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Palace Pitti was begun by one of the Strozzi, who boasted
that he would build a palace with a court-yard in it, in which another
palace might dance. He had nearly ruined himself by the expense,
when one of the Medici took it off his hands and completed it. It
is at present the residence of the Grand Duke. The view within
over the court-yard to the terrace and mount above is superb. Here
is the Venus of Canova, an elegant sylph-like figure; but Canova was
more to be admired for delicacy of finishing, than for expression or
conception of general form. At the Gallery there is one room full
of extraordinary pictures and statues: at the Palace Pitti there are
six or seven covered with some of the finest portraits and history-pieces
in the world, and the walls are dark with beauty, and breathe
an air of the highest art from them. It is one of the richest and
most original Collections I have seen. It is not so remarkable for
variety of style or subject as for a noble opulence and aristocratic
pride, having to boast names in the highest ranks of art, and many of
their best works. The Palace Pitti formerly figured in the Catalogue
of the Louvre, which it had contributed to enrich with many of its
most gorgeous jewels, which have been brought back to their original
situation, and which now shine here, though not with unreflected
lustre, nor in solitary state. Among these, for instance, is Titian’s
Hippolito di Medici (which the late Mr. Opie pronounced the finest
portrait in the world), with the spirit and breadth of history, and with
the richness, finish, and glossiness of an enamel picture. I remember
the first time I ever saw it, it stood on an easel which I had to pass,
with the back to me, and as I turned and saw it with the boar-spear
in its hand, and its keen glance bent upon me, it seemed ‘a thing of
life,’ with supernatural force and grandeur. The famous music-piece
by Giorgioni was at one time in the Louvre, and is not a whit
inferior to Titian. The head turned round of the man playing on
the harpsichord, for air, expression, and a true gusto of colouring,
may challenge competition all the world through. There goes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>tradition that these are the portraits of Luther and Calvin. Giorgioni
died at the age of thirty-four, heart-broken, it is said, because one of
his scholars had robbed him of his mistress—possibly the very beauty
whose picture is introduced here. Leo X., by Raphael, that fine,
stern, globular head, on which ‘deliberation sits and public care,’ is
in the same room with the Cardinal Bentivoglio, one of Vandyke’s
happiest and most <em>spiritual</em> heads—a fine group of portraits by Rubens,
of himself, his brother, Grotius and Justus Lipsius, all in one frame—an
admirable Holy Family, in this master’s very best manner, by
Julio Romano—and the Madonna della Seggia of Raphael—all of
these were formerly in the Louvre. The last is painted on wood,
and worn, so as to have a crayon look. But for the grouping, the
unconscious look of intelligence in the children, and the rounding and
fleshiness of the forms of their limbs, this is one of the artist’s most
unrivalled works. There are also several by Andrea del Sarto, conceived
and finished with the highest taste and truth of feeling; a
Nymph and Satyr by Giorgioni, of great gusto; Hercules and
Antæus, by Schiavoni (an admirable study of bold drawing and
poetical colouring), an unfinished sketch by Guido, several by Cigoli
and Fra. Bartolomeo; a girl in a flowered dress, by Titian (of
which Mr. Northcote possesses a beautiful copy by Sir Joshua);
another portrait of a Man in front view and a Holy Family, by the
same; and one or two fine pieces by Rubens and Rembrandt.
There is a Parmegiano here, in which is to be seen the origin of
Mr. Fuseli’s style, a child in its mother’s lap, with its head rolling
away from its body, the mother’s face looking down upon it with
green and red cheeks tapering to a point, and a thigh of an angel,
which you cannot well piece to an urn which he carries in his hand,
and which seems like a huge scale of the ‘shard-borne beetle.’—The
grotesque and discontinuous are, in fact, carried to their height.
Here is also the Conspiracy of Catiline, by Salvator Rosa, which
looks more like a Cato-street Conspiracy than any thing else, or a
bargain struck in a blacksmith’s shop; and a Battle-piece by the same
artist, with the round haunches and flowing tail of a white horse
repeated, and some fierce faces, hid by the smoke and their helmets,
of which you can make neither head nor tail. Salvator was a great
landscape-painter; but both he and Lady Morgan have been guilty
of a great piece of <em>egotism</em> in supposing that he was any thing more.
These are the chief failures, but in general out of heaps of pictures
there is scarce one that is not of the highest interest both in itself,
and from collateral circumstances. Those who come in search of
high Italian art will here find it in perfection; and if they do not
feel this, they may turn back at once. The pictures in the Pitti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Palace are finely preserved, and have that deep, mellow tone of age
upon them which is to the eyes of a connoisseur in painting as the
rust of medals or the crust on wine is to connoisseurs and judges of a
different stamp.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p class='c008'>The road between Florence and Rome by Sienna is not very interesting,
though it presents a number of reflections to those who are well
acquainted with the changes that have taken place in the history and
agriculture of these districts. Shortly after you leave Florence, the
way becomes dreary and barren or unhealthy. Towards the close of
the first day’s journey, however, we had a splendid view of the
country we were to travel, which lay stretched out beneath our feet
to an immense distance, as we descended into the little town of Pozzo
Borgo. Deep valleys sloped on each side of us, from which the
smoke of cottages occasionally curled: the branches of an overhanging
birch-tree or a neighbouring ruin gave relief to the grey, misty landscape,
which was streaked by dark pine-forests, and speckled by the
passing clouds; and in the extreme distance rose a range of hills
glittering in the evening sun, and scarcely distinguishable from the
ridge of clouds that hovered near them. We did not reach these
hills (on the top of one of which stands the fort of Radicofani) till
the end of two days’ journey, making a distance of between fifty and
sixty miles, so that their miniature size and fairy splendour, as they
crowned the far-off horizon, may be easily guessed. We did not
find the accommodation on the road quite so bad as we had expected.
The chief want is of milk, which is to be had only in the morning;
but we remedied this defect by a taking a bottle of it with us. The
weather was cold enough (in the middle of March) to freeze it.
The economy of life is here reduced to a very great simplicity,
absolute necessaries from day to day and from hand to mouth; and
nothing is allowed for the chapter of accidents, or the irregular
intrusion of strangers. The mechanism of English inns is accounted
for by the certainty of the arrival of customers, with full pockets and
empty stomachs. There every road is a thoroughfare; here a
traveller is a curiosity, and we did not meet ten carriages on our
journey, a distance of a hundred and ninety-three miles, and which it
took us six days to accomplish. I may add that we paid only seven
louis for our two places in the Voiture (which, besides, we had
entirely to ourselves) our expences on the road included. This is
cheap enough.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Sienna is a fine old town, but more like a receptacle of the dead
than the residence of the living. ‘<span class='sc'>It was</span>,’ might be written over
the entrance to this, as to most of the towns in Italy. The
magnificence of the buildings corresponds but ill with the squalidness
of the inhabitants; there seems no reason for crowding the streets so
close together when there are so few people in them. There is at
present no enemy without to huddle them together within the walls,
whatever might have been the case in former times: for miles you do
not meet a human being, or discern the traces of a human dwelling.
The view through the noble arch of the gate as you leave Sienna is
at once exquisitely romantic and picturesque: otherwise, the country
presents a most deplorable aspect for a length of way. Nature seems
to have here taken it upon her to play the part of a cinder-wench, and
to have thrown up her incessant heaps of clay and ashes, without
either dignity or grace. At a distance to the right and left, you see
the stately remains of the ancient Etruscan cities, cresting the heights
and built for defence; and here and there, perched on the top of a
cliff, the ruinous haunt of some bandit chief (the scourge of later
days), that might be compared in imagination to some dragon, old
and blind, still watching for its long-lost prey, and sharing the
desolation it has made. There are two of these near the wretched
inn of La Scala, where we stopped the third morning, rising in lonely
horror from the very point of two hills, facing each other and only
divided by a brook, that baffle description, and require the artist’s
boldest pencil. Aided by the surrounding gloom, and shrouded by
the driving mist (as they were when we passed), they throw the
mind back into a trance of former times, and the cry of midnight
revelry, of midnight murder is heard from the crumbling walls. The
romantic bridge and hamlet under them begins the ascent of Radicofani.
The extensive ruin at the top meets your view and disappears
repeatedly during the long, winding, toilsome ascent. Over a
tremendous valley to the left, we saw the distant hills of Perugia,
covered with snow and blackened with clouds, and a heavy sleet was
falling around us. We started, on being told that the post-house
stood directly on the other side of the fort (at a height of 2400 feet
above the level of the sea), and that we were to pass the night there.
It was like being lodged in a cloud: it seemed the very rocking-cradle
of storms and tempests. As we wound round the road at the
foot of it, we were relieved from our apprehensions. It was a
fortress built by stubborn violence for itself, that might be said to
scowl defiance on the world below, and to promise security and
shelter to those within its reach. Huge heaps of round stones,
gnarled like iron, and that looked as if they would break the feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that trusted themselves among them, were rolled into the space
between the heights and the road-side. The middle or principal turret,
which rose between the other two, was thrown into momentary perspective
by the mist; a fragment of an outer wall stood beneath, half
covered with ivy; close to it was an old chapel-spire built of red
brick, and a small hamlet crouched beneath the ramparts. It reminded
me, by its preternatural strength and sullen aspect, of the
castle of Giant Despair in <cite>The Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>. The dark and
stern spirit of former times might be conceived to have entrenched
itself here as in its last hold; to have looked out and laughed at
precipices and storms, and the puny assaults of hostile bands, and
resting on its red right arm, to have wasted away through inaction
and disuse in its unapproachable solitude and barbarous desolation.
Never did I see any thing so rugged and so stately, apparently so
formidable in a former period, so forlorn in this. It was a majestic
shadow of the mighty past, suspended in another region, belonging to
another age. I might take leave of it in the words of old Burnet,
whose Latin glows among these cold hills, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vale augusta sedes, digna
rege; vale augusta rupes, semper mihi memoranda!</span></i>—We drove into
the inn-yard, which resembled a barrack (so do most of the inns on
the road), with its bed-rooms like hospital-wards, and its large apartments
for assemblages of armed men, now empty, gloomy, and
unfurnished; but where we found a hospitable welcome, and by the
aid of a double fee to the waiters every thing very comfortable. The
first object was to procure milk for our tea (of which last article we
had brought some very good from the shop of Signor Pippini, at
Florence<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a>) and the next thing was to lay in a stock for the remaining
half of our journey. We were not sorry to pass a night at the height
of 2400 feet above the level of the sea, and immediately under this
famous fortress. The winds ‘howled through the vacant guard-rooms
and deserted lobbies’ of our hostelry, and the snow descended
in a heavy fall, and covered the valleys; but Radicofani looked the
same, as we saw it through the coach-windows the next morning,
old, grey, deserted, gloomy, as if it had survived ‘a thousand storms,
a thousand winters’—the peasant still crawled along its trenches, the
traveller stopped to gaze at its battlements—but neither spear nor
battle-axe would glitter there again, nor banner be spread, nor the
clash of arms be heard in the round of ever-rolling years—it looked
back to other times as we looked back upon it, and stood towering
in its decay, and nodding to an eternal repose! The road
in this, as in other parts of Italy, is evidently calculated, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>originally constructed, for the march of an army. Instead of creeping
along the valleys, it passes along the ridges of hills to prevent surprise,
or watch the movements of an enemy, and thus generally commands
an extensive view of the country, such as it is. It was long before
winding slowly into the valley, we lost sight of our last night’s station.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aquapendente is situated on the brow of a hill, over a running
stream, as its name indicates, and the ascent to it is up the side of a
steep rugged ravine, with overhanging rocks and shrubs. The
mixture of wildness and luxuriance answered to my idea of Italian
scenery, but I had seen little of it hitherto. The town is old, dirty,
and disagreeable; and we were driven to an inn in one of the bye-streets,
where there was but one sitting-room, which was occupied by
an English family, who were going to leave it immediately, but who,
I suppose, on hearing that some one else was waiting for it, claimed
the right of keeping it as long as they pleased. The assertion of an
abstract right is the idea uppermost in the minds of all English people.
Unfortunately, when its attainment is worth any thing, their spirit of
contradiction makes them ready to relinquish it; or when it costs
them any thing, their spirit of self-interest deters them from the
pursuit! After waiting some time, we at last breakfasted in a sort of
kitchen or outhouse upstairs, where we had very excellent but homely
fare, and where we were amused with the furniture—a dove-house,
a kid, half-skinned, hanging on the walls; a loose heap of macaroni
and vegetables in one corner, plenty of smoke, a Madonna carved and
painted, and a map of Constantinople. The pigeons on the floor
were busy with their murmuring plaints, and often fluttered their
wings as if to fly. So, thought I, the nations of the earth clap their
wings, and strive in vain to be free! The landlady was a woman
about forty, diminutive and sickly, but with one of those pale, mild,
penetrating faces which one seldom sees out of Italy. She was the
mother of two buxom daughters, as coarse and hard as any thing of
the kind one might meet with in Herefordshire or Gloucestershire!
The road from Aquapendente is of a deep heavy soil, over which the
horses with difficulty dragged the carriage, The view on one side
was bounded by two fine conical hills clothed to the very top with
thick woods of beech and fir; and our route lay for miles over an
undulating ground covered with the wild broom (growing to the size
of a large shrub), among which herds of slate-coloured oxen were seen
browzing luxuriously. The broom floated above them, their covering
and their food, with its flexible silken branches of light green, and
presented an eastern scene, extensive, soft and wild. We passed, I
think, but one habitation between Aquapendente and San Lorenzo,
and met but one human being, which was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gen d’Armes</span></i>! I asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>our Vetturino if this dreary aspect of the country was the effect of
nature or of art. He pulled a handful of earth from the hedge-side,
and shewed a rich black loam, capable of every improvement. I
asked in whose dominions we were, and received for answer, ‘In the
Pope’s.’ San Lorenzo is a town built on the summit of a hill, in
consequence of the ravages of the <em>malaria</em> in the old town, situated in
the valley below. It looks like a large alms-house, or else like a
town that has run away from the plague and itself, and stops suddenly
on the brow of a hill to see if the Devil is following it. The ruins
below are the most ghastly I ever saw. The scattered fragments of
walls and houses are crumbling away like rotten bones, and there are
holes in the walls and subterraneous passages, in which disease, like
an ugly witch, seems to lurk and to forbid your entrance. Further
on, and winding round the edge of the lake, you come to Bolsena.
The unwholesome nature of the air from the water may be judged of
from the colour of the tops of the houses, the moss on which is as
yellow as the jaundice, and the grass and corn-fields on its borders are
of a tawny green. The road between this and Monte-Fiascone,
which you see on an eminence before you, lies through a range of
gloomy defiles, and is deformed by the blackened corses of huge oak-trees,
that strew the road-side, the unsightly relics of fine old woods
that were cut down and half-burnt a few years ago as the haunts of
bands of robbers. They plant morals in this country by rooting up
trees! While the country is worth seeing, it is not safe to travel;
but picturesque beauty must, of course, give place to the police. I
thought, when I first saw these cadaverous trunks lying by the side
of the lake, that they were the useless remains of cargoes of timber
that we had purchased of the Holy See to fight its battles, and maintain
the cause of social order in every part of the world! Let no English
traveller stop at Monte-Fiascone (I mean at the inn outside the town),
unless he would be starved and smoke-dried, but pass on to Viterbo,
which is a handsome town, with the best inn on the road. You pass
one night more on the road in this mode of travelling (which resembles
walking a minuet, rather than striking up a country dance) at
Ronciglione; and the next day from Baccano, you see rising up, in
a flat, hazy plain, the dome of St. Peter’s. You proceed for some miles
along a gradual descent without any object of much interest, pass the
Tiber and the gate <em>Del Popolo</em>, and you are in Rome. When there,
go any where but to Franks’s Hotel, and get a lodging, if possible, on
the Via Gregoriana, which overlooks the town, and where you can
feast the eye and indulge in sentiment, without being poisoned by bad
air. The house of Salvator Rosa is at present let out in lodgings. I
have now lived twice in houses occupied by celebrated men, once in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>a house that had belonged to Milton, and now in this, and find to my
mortification that imagination, is entirely a <em>thing imaginary</em>, and has
nothing to do with matter of fact, history, or the senses. To see an
object of thought or fancy is just as impossible as to feel a sound or
hear a smell.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p class='c008'>‘As London is to the meanest country town, so is Rome to every
other city in the world.’</p>

<p class='c000'>So said an old friend of mine, and I believed him till I saw it.
This is not the Rome I expected to see. No one from being in it
would know he was in the place that had been twice mistress of the
world. I do not understand how Nicolas Poussin could tell, taking
up a handful of earth, that it was ‘a part of the <span class='sc'>Eternal City</span>.’
In Oxford an air of learning breathes from the very walls: halls and
colleges meet your eye in every direction; you cannot for a moment
forget where you are. In London there is a look of wealth and
populousness which is to be found nowhere else. In Rome you are
for the most part lost in a mass of tawdry, fulsome <em>common-places</em>. It
is not the contrast of pig-styes and palaces that I complain of, the
distinction between the old and new; what I object to is the want of
any such striking contrast, but an almost uninterrupted succession of
narrow, vulgar-looking streets, where the smell of garlick prevails
over the odour of antiquity, with the dingy, melancholy flat fronts of
modern-built houses, that seem in search of an owner. A dunghill,
an outhouse, the weeds growing under an imperial arch offend me not;
but what has a green-grocer’s stall, a stupid English china warehouse,
a putrid <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">trattoria</span></i>, a barber’s sign, an old clothes or old picture shop or
a Gothic palace, with two or three lacqueys in modern liveries lounging
at the gate, to do with ancient Rome? No! this is not the wall
that Romulus leaped over: this is not the Capitol where Julius Cæsar
fell: instead of standing on seven hills, it is situated in a low valley:
the golden Tiber is a muddy stream: St. Peter’s is not equal to
St. Paul’s: the Vatican falls short of the Louvre, as it was in my
time; but I thought that here were works immoveable, immortal, inimitable
on earth, and lifting the soul half way to heaven. I find them
not, or only what I had seen before in different ways: the Stanzas
of Raphael are faded, or no better than the prints; and the mind of
Michael Angelo’s figures, of which no traces are to be found in the
copies, is equally absent from the walls of the Sistine Chapel. Rome
is great only in ruins: the Coliseum, the Pantheon, the Arch of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Constantine fully answered my expectations; and an air breathes
round her stately avenues, serene, blissful, like the mingled breath of
spring and winter, betwixt life and death, betwixt hope and despair.
The country about Rome is cheerless and barren. There is little
verdure, nor are any trees planted, on account of their bad effects on
the air. Happy climate! in which shade and sunshine are alike fatal.
The Jews (I may add while I think of it) are shut up here in a
quarter by themselves. I see no reason for it. It is a distinction
not worth the making. There was a talk (it being <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anno Santo</span></i>) of
shutting them up for the whole of the present year. A soldier stands
at the gate, to tell you that this is the Jews’ quarter, and to take any
thing you choose to give him for this piece of Christian information.
A Catholic church stands outside their prison, with a Crucifixion
painted on it as a frontispiece, where they are obliged to hear a sermon
in behalf of the truth of the Christian religion every Good Friday.
On the same day they used to make them run races in the Corso, for
the amusement of the rabble (high and low)—now they are compelled
to provide horses for the same purpose. Owing to the politeness of
the age, they no longer burn them as of yore, and that is something.
Religious zeal, like all other things, grows old and feeble. They
treat the Jews in this manner at Rome (as a local courtesy to St.
Peter), and yet they compliment <em>us</em> on our increasing liberality to the
Irish Catholics. The Protestant chapel here stands outside the walls,
while there is a British monument to the memory of the Stuarts, inside
of St. Peter’s; the tombs in the English burying-ground were destroyed
and defaced not long ago; yet this did not prevent the Prince Regent
from exchanging portraits with the Pope and his Ministers!—‘Oh!
liberalism—lovely liberalism!’ as Mr. Blackwood would say.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the window of the house where I lodge, I have a view of
the whole city at once: nay, I can see St. Peter’s as I lie in bed of a
morning. The town is an immense mass of solid stone-buildings,
streets, palaces, and churches; but it has not the beauty of the
environs of Florence, nor the splendid background of Turin, nor does
it present any highly picturesque or commanding points of view like
Edinburgh. The pleasantest walks I know are round the Via
Sistina, and along the Via di Quattro-Fontane—they overlook Rome
from the North-East on to the churches of Santa Maria Maggiore,
and of St. John Lateran, towards the gate leading to Naples. As
we loiter on, our attention was caught by an open greensward to the
left, with foot-paths, and a ruined wall and gardens on each side. A
carriage stood in the road just by, and a gentleman and lady, with
a little child, had got out of it to walk. A soldier and a girl were
seen talking together further on, and a herd of cattle were feeding at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>their leisure on the yielding turf. The day was close and dry—not
a breath stirred. All was calm and silent. It had been cold when
we set out, but here the air was soft—of an Elysian temperature, as
if the winds did not dare to visit the sanctuaries of the dead too
roughly. The daisy sprung beneath our feet—the fruit-trees blossomed
within the nodding arches. On one side were seen the hills of Albano,
on the other the Claudian gate; and close by was Nero’s Golden
House, where there were seventy thousand statues and pillars, of
marble and of silver, and where senates kneeled, and myriads shouted
in honour of a frail mortal, as of a God. Come here, oh man! and
worship thine own spirit, that can hoard up, as in a shrine, the
treasures of two thousand years, and can create out of the memory of
fallen splendours and departed grandeur a solitude deeper than that of
desert wildernesses, and pour from the out-goings of thine own thoughts
a thunder louder than that of maddening multitudes! No place was
ever so still as this; for none was ever the scene of such pomp and
triumph! Not far from this are the Baths of Titus; the grass and
the poppy (the flower of oblivion) grow over them, and in the vaults
below they shew you (by the help of a torch) paintings on the ceiling
eighteen hundred years old, birds, and animals, a figure of a slave, a
nymph and a huntsman, fresh and elegantly foreshortened, and also
the place where the Laocoon was discovered. A few paces off is
the Coliseum, or Amphitheatre of Titus, the noblest ruin in Rome.
It is circular, built of red stone and brick, with arched windows, and
the gillyflower and fennel growing on its walls to the very top: one
side is nearly perfect. As you pass under it, it seems to raise itself
above you, and mingle with the sky in its majestic simplicity, as if
earth were a thing too gross for it; it stands almost unconscious of
decay, and may still stand for ages—though Mr. Hobhouse has
written Annotations upon it! There is a hypocritical inscription on
it, to say that it has been kept in repair by the Popes, in order to
preserve the memory of the martyrs that suffered here in cruel
combats with wild beasts. As I have alluded to this subject, I will
add that I think the finest stanza in Lord Byron is that where he
describes the <cite>Dying Gladiator</cite>, who falls and does not hear the shout
of barbarous triumph echoing from these very walls:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>The temple of Vesta is on the Tiber. It is not unlike an hour-glass—or
a toad-stool; it is small, but exceedingly beautiful, and has
a look of great antiquity. The Pantheon is also as fine as possible.
It has the most perfect unity of effect. It was hardly a proper
receptacle for the Gods of the Heathens, for it has a simplicity and
grandeur like the vaulted cope of Heaven. Compared with these
admired remains of former times I must say that the more modern
churches and palaces in Rome are poor, flashy, upstart looking things.
Even the dome of St. Peter’s is for the most part hid by the front,
and the Vatican has no business by its side. The sculptures there are
also indifferent, and the mosaics, except two—the Transfiguration
and St. Jerome, ill chosen. I was lucky enough to see the Pope
here on Easter Sunday. He seems a harmless, infirm, fretful old
man. I confess I should feel little ambition to be at the head of a
procession, at which the ignorant stare, the better informed smile.
I was also lucky enough to see St. Peter’s illuminated to the very
top (a project of Michael Angelo’s) in the evening. It was finest
at first, as the kindled lights blended with the fading twilight. It
seemed doubtful whether it were an artificial illumination, the work
of carpenters and torch-bearers, or the reflection of an invisible sun.
One half of the cross shone with the richest gold, and rows of lamps
gave light as from a sky. At length a shower of fairy lights burst
out at a signal in all directions, and covered the whole building.
It looked better at a distance than when we went nearer it. It
continued blazing all night. What an effect it must have upon the
country round! Now and then a life or so is lost in lighting up the
huge fabric, but what is this to the glory of the church and the salvation
of souls, to which it no doubt tends? I can easily conceive some
of the wild groups that I saw in the streets the following day to have
been led by delight and wonder from their mountain-haunts, or even
from the bandits’ cave, to worship at this new starry glory, rising
from the earth. The whole of the immense space before St. Peter’s
was in the afternoon crowded with people to see the Pope give his
benediction. The rich dresses of the country people, the strong
features and orderly behaviour of all, gave this assemblage a decided
superiority over any thing of the kind I had seen in England. I did
not hear the <em>Miserere</em> which is chaunted by the Priests, and sung by
a single voice (I understand like an angel’s) in a dim religious light
in the Sistine Chapel; nor did I see the exhibition of the relics, at
which I was told all the beauty of Rome was present. It is something
even to miss such things. After all, St. Peter’s does not seem
to me the chief boast or most imposing display of the Catholic
religion. Old Melrose Abbey, battered to pieces and in ruins, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>it is, impresses me much more than the collective pride and pomp of
Michael Angelo’s great work. Popery is here at home, and may
strut and swell and deck itself out as it pleases, on the spot and for
the occasion. It is the pageant of an hour. But to stretch out its
arm fifteen hundred miles, to create a voice in the wilderness, to have
left its monuments standing by the Teviot-side, or to send the midnight
hymn through the shades of Vallombrosa, or to make it echo
among Alpine solitudes, that is faith, and that is power. The rest is
a puppet-shew! I am no admirer of Pontificals, but I am a slave to
the picturesque. The Priests talking together in St. Peter’s, or the
common people kneeling at the altars, make groups that shame all art.
The inhabitants of the city have something French about them—something
of the cook’s and the milliner’s shop—something pert,
gross, and cunning; but the Roman peasants redeem the credit of
their golden sky. The young women that come here from Gensano
and Albano, and that are known by their scarlet boddices and white
head-dresses and handsome good-humoured faces, are the finest
specimens I have ever seen of human nature. They are like
creatures that have breathed the air of Heaven, till the sun has
ripened them into perfect beauty, health, and goodness. They are
universally admired in Rome. The English women that you see,
though pretty, are pieces of dough to them. Little troops and
whole families, men, women, and children, from the Campagna and
neighbouring districts of Rome, throng the streets during Easter
and Lent, who come to visit the shrine of some favourite Saint,
repeating their <em>Aves</em> aloud, and telling their beads with all the
earnestness imaginable. Popery is no farce to them. They surely
think St. Peter’s is the way to Heaven. You even see priests
counting their beads, and looking grave. If they can contrive to
get possession of this world for themselves, and give the laity the
reversion of the next, were it only in imagination, something is
to be said for the exchange. I only hate half-way houses in religion
or politics, that take from us all the benefits of ignorance and superstition,
and give us none of the advantages of liberty or philosophy
in return. Thus I hate Princes who usurp the thrones of others,
and would almost give them back, sooner than allow the rights of
the people. Once more, how does that monument to the Stuarts
happen to be stuck up in the side-aisle of St. Peter’s? I would
ask the person who placed it there, how many Georges there have
been since James <span class='fss'>III.</span>? His ancestor makes but an ambiguous figure
beside the posthumous group—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>The only thing unpleasant in the motley assemblage of persons at
Rome, is the number of pilgrims with their greasy oil-skin cloaks.
They are a dirty, disgusting set, with a look of sturdy hypocrisy
about them. The Pope (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro formâ</span></i>) washes their feet; the Nuns,
when they come, have even a less delicate office to perform. Religion,
in the depth of its humility, ought not to forget decorum. But I am
a traveller, and not a reformer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The picture-galleries in Rome disappointed me quite. I was told
there were a dozen at least, equal to the Louvre; there is not one.
I shall not dwell long upon them, for they gave me little pleasure.
At the Ruspigliosi Palace (near the Monte Cavallo, where are the
famous Colossal groups, said to be by Phidias and Praxiteles, of one
of which we have a cast in Hyde Park) are the Aurora and the
Andromeda, by Guido. The first is a most splendid composition
(like the Daughter of the Dawn) but painted in fresco; and the
artist has, in my mind, failed through want of practice in the grace
and colouring of most of the figures. They are a clumsy, gloomy-looking
set, and not like Guido’s females. The Andromeda has all
the charm and sweetness of his pencil, in its pearly tones, its graceful
timid action, and its lovely expression of gentleness and terror. The
face, every part of the figure, has a beauty and softness not to be
described. This one figure is worth all the other group, and the
Apollo, the horses and the azure sea to boot. People talk of the
insipidity of Guido. Oh! let me drink long, repeated, relishing
draughts of such insipidity! If delicacy, beauty, and grace are
insipidity, I too profess myself an idolizer of insipidity: I will
venture one assertion, which is, that no other painter has expressed
the female character so well, so truly, so entirely in its fragile,
lovely essence, neither Raphael, nor Titian, nor Correggio; and,
after these, it is needless to mention any more. Raphael’s women
are Saints; Titian’s are courtesans; Correggio’s an affected mixture
of both; Guido’s are the true heroines of romance, the brides of the
fancy, such as ‘youthful poets dream of when they love,’ or as a
Clarissa, a Julia de Roubigne, or a Miss Milner would turn out to
be! They are not only angels, but young ladies into the bargain,
which is more than can be said for any of the others, and yet it is
something to say. Vandyke sometimes gave this effect in portrait,
but his historical figures are fanciful and sprawling. Under the
Andromeda is a portrait by Nicholas Poussin of himself (a duplicate
of that in the Louvre), and an infant Cupid or Bacchus, by the same
artist, finely coloured, and executed in the manner of Titian. There
is in another room an unmeaning picture, by Annibal Caracci, of
Samson pulling down the temple of the Philistines, and also a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>dead Christ by him; add to these a Diana and Endymion by
Guercino, in which the real sentiment of the story is thrown into
the landscape and figures. The Ruspigliosi Pavilion, containing
these and some inferior pictures, is situated near the remains of
Constantine’s Bath in a small raised garden or terrace, in which
the early violets and hyacinths blossom amidst broken cisterns and
defaced statues. It is a pretty picture; art decays, but nature still
survives through all changes. At the Doria Palace, there is nothing
remarkable but the two Claudes, and these are much injured in colour.
The trees are black, and the water looks like lead. There are
several Garofolos, which are held in esteem here (not unjustly) and
one fine head by Titian. The Velasquez (Innocent <span class='fss'>X.</span>), so much
esteemed by Sir Joshua, is a spirited sketch. The Borghese Palace
has three fine pictures, and only three—the Diana and Actæon of
Domenichino; the Taking down from the Cross, by Raphael; and
Titian’s Sacred and Profane Love. This last picture has a peculiar
and inexpressible charm about it. It is something between portrait
and allegory, a mixture of history and landscape, simple and yet
quaint, fantastical yet without meaning to be so, but as if a sudden
thought had struck the painter, and he could not help attempting to
execute it out of curiosity, and finishing it from the delight it gave
him. It is full of sweetness and solemnity. The Diana of Domenichino
is just the reverse of it. Every thing here is arranged methodically,
and is the effect of study and forethought. Domenichino was
a painter of sense, feeling, and taste; but his pencil was meagre, and
his imagination dispirited and impoverished. In Titian, the execution
surpassed the design, and the force of his hand and eye, as he went
on, enriched the most indifferent outline: in Domenichino, the filling
up fell short of the conception and of his own wishes. He was a
man of great modesty and merit; and when others expressed an
admiration of his talents, they were obliged to reckon up a number
of his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> to convince him that they were in earnest. He
could hardly believe that any one else thought much of his works,
when he thought so little of them himself. Raphael’s Taking down
from the Cross is in his early manner, and the outlines of the limbs
are like the edges of plates of tin; but it has what was inseparable
from his productions, first and last, pregnant expression and careful
drawing. I ought to mention that there is, by the same master-hand,
a splendid portrait of Cæsar Borgia, which is an addition to my list.
The complexion is a strange mixture of orange and purple. The
hair of his sister, Lucretia Borgia (the friend and mistress of Cardinal
Bembo) is still preserved in Italy, and a lock of it was in the possession
of Lord Byron. I lately saw it in company with that of Milton
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>and of Bonaparte, looking calm, golden, beautiful, a smiling trophy
from the grave! The number and progressive improvement of
Raphael’s works in Italy is striking. It might teach our holiday
artists that to do well is to do much. Excellence springs up behind
us, not before us; and is the result of what we have done, not of
what we intend to do. Many artists (especially those abroad, who
are distracted with a variety of styles and models) never advance
beyond the contemplation of some great work, and think to lay in an
unexampled store of accomplishments, before they commence any
undertaking. That is where they ought to end; to begin with it is
too much. It is as if the foundation-stone should form the cupola of
St. Peter’s. Great works are the result of much labour and of many
failures, and not of pompous pretensions and fastidious delicacy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Corsini pictures are another large and very indifferent collection.
All I can recollect worth mentioning are, a very sweet and
silvery-toned Herodias, by Guido; a fine landscape, by Gaspar
Poussin; an excellent sketch from Ariosto of the Giant Orgagna;
and the Plague of Milan by a modern artist, a work of great invention
and judgment, and in which the details of the subject are so
managed as to affect, and not to shock. The Campidoglio collection
is better. There is a large and admirable Guercino, an airy and
richly-coloured Guido, some capital little Garofolos, a beautiful copy
of a Repose of Titian’s by Pietro da Cortona, several Giorgiones,
and a number of antique busts of the most interesting description.
Here is the bronze She-Wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus, and
the Geese that cackled in the Capitol. I find nothing so delightful
as these old Roman heads of Senators, Warriors, Philosophers.
They have all the freshness of truth and nature. They shew something
substantial in mortality. They are the only things that do not
crush and overturn our sense of personal identity; and are a fine
relief to the mouldering relics of antiquity, and to the momentary
littleness of modern things! The little Farnese contains the Galatea
and the Cupid and Psyche. If any thing could have raised my idea
of Raphael higher, it would have been some of these frescoes. I
would mention the group of the Graces in particular; they are true
Goddesses. The fine flowing outline of the limbs, the variety of
attitudes, the unconscious grace, the charming unaffected glow of the
expression, are inimitable. Raphael never perhaps escaped so completely
from the trammels of his first manner, as in this noble series
of designs. The Galatea has been injured in colour by the stoves
which the Germans, who were quartered there, lighted in the apartment.
In the same room is the famous chalk head, said to have
been sketched upon the wall by Michael Angelo. The story is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>probably a fabrication; the head is as coarse and mechanical as any
thing can be. Raphael’s Loggia in the corridors of the Vatican
(the subjects of what is called his Bible) appear to me divine in
form, relief, conception—above all, the figure of Eve at the forbidden
tree; his Stanzas there appear to me divine, more particularly the
Heliodorus, the School of Athens, and the Miracle of Bolseno, with
all the truth and force of character of Titian’s portraits (I see
nothing, however, of his colouring) and his own purity, sweetness,
and lofty invention, added to them. His oil pictures there are
divine. The Transfiguration is a wonderful collection of fine heads
and figures: their fault is, that they are too detached and bare, but
it is not true that it embraces two distinct points of time. The
event below is going on in the Gospel account, at the same time with
the miracle of the Transfiguration above. But I almost prefer to
this the Foligno picture: the child with the casket below is of all
things the most Raphaelesque, for the sweetness of expression, and
the rich pulpy texture of the flesh; and perhaps I prefer even to this
the Crowning of the Virgin, with that pure dignified figure of the
Madonna sitting in the clouds, and that wonderous emanation of
sentiment in the crowd below, near the vase of flowers, all whose
faces are bathed in one feeling of ecstatic devotion, as the stream
of inspiration flows over them. There is a singular effect of colouring
in the lower part of this picture, as if it were painted on slate,
and from this cold chilly ground the glow of sentiment comes out
perhaps the more strong and effectual. In the same suite of apartments
(accessible to students and copyists) are the Death of St.
Jerome, by Domenichino; and the Vision of St. Romuald, by
Andrea Sacchi, the last of the Italian painters. Five nobler or
more impressive pictures are not in the world. A single figure of
St. Michelle (as a pilgrim among the Alps) is a pure rich offering of
the pencil to legendary devotion, and remarkable for the simplicity of
the colouring, sweetness of the expression, and the gloomy splendour
of the background. There are no others equally good. The Vatican
contains numberless fine statues and other remains of antiquity, elegant
and curious. The Apollo I do not admire, but the Laocoon appears
to me admirable, for the workmanship, for the muscular contortions
of the father’s figure, and the divine expression of the sentiment of
pain and terror in the children. They are, however, rather small
than young. Canova’s figures here seem to me the work of an
accomplished sculptor, but not of a great man. Michael Angelo’s
figures of Day and Night, at the Chapel of St. Lorenzo at Florence,
are those of a great man; whether of a perfect sculptor or not, I
will not pretend to say. The neck of the Night is curved like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>horse’s, the limbs have the involution of serpents. These two figures
and his transporting the Pantheon to the top of St. Peter’s, have
settled my wavering idea of this mighty genius, which his David and
early works at Florence had staggered. His Adam receiving life
from his Creator, in the Sistine Chapel, for boldness and freedom,
is more like the Elgin Theseus than any other figure I have seen.
The Jeremiah in the same ceiling droops and bows the head like
a willow-tree surcharged with showers. Whether there are any
faces worthy of these noble figures I have not been near enough to
see. Those near the bottom of the Last Judgment are hideous,
vulgar caricatures of demons and cardinals, and the whole is a mass
of extravagance and confusion. I shall endeavour to get a nearer
view of the Prophets and Sybils in the Capella Sistina. And if I
can discover an expression and character of thought in them equal
to their grandeur of form, I shall not be slow to acknowledge it.
Michael Angelo is one of those names that cannot be shaken without
pulling down Fame itself. The Vatican is rich in pictures, statuary,
tapestry, gardens, and in the views from it; but its immense size is
divided into too many long and narrow compartments, and it wants
the unity of effect and imposing gravity of the Louvre.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<p class='c008'>There are two things that an Englishman understands, hard words
and hard blows. Nothing short of this (generally speaking) excites
his attention or interests him in the least. His neighbours have the
benefit of the one in war time, and his own countrymen of the other
in time of peace. The French express themselves astonished at the
feats which our Jack Tars have so often performed. A fellow in
that class of life in England will strike his hand through a deal board—first,
to shew his strength, which he is proud of; secondly, to give
him a sensation, which he is in want of; lastly to prove his powers
of endurance, which he also makes a boast of. So qualified, a controversy
with a cannon-ball is not much out of his way: a thirty-two
pounder is rather an <em>ugly customer</em>, but it presents him with a tangible
idea (a thing he is always in search of)—and, should it take off his
head or carry away one of his limbs, he does not feel the want of the
one or care for that of the other. Naturally obtuse, his feelings
become hardened by custom; or if there are any qualms of repugnance
or dismay left, a volley of oaths, a few coarse jests, and a double
allowance of grog soon turn the affair into a pastime. Stung with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>wounds, stunned with bruises, bleeding and mangled, an English
sailor never finds himself so much alive as when he is flung half dead
into the cockpit; for he then perceives the extreme consciousness of
his existence in his conflict with external matter, in the violence of
his will, and his obstinate contempt for suffering. He feels his
personal identity on the side of the disagreeable and repulsive; and it
is better to feel it so than to be a stock or a stone, which is his
ordinary state. Pain puts life into him; action, soul: otherwise,
he is a mere log. The English are not like a nation of women.
They are not thin-skinned, nervous, or effeminate, but dull and
morbid: they look danger and difficulty in the face, and shake hands
with death as with a brother. They do not hold up their heads, but
they will turn their backs on no man: they delight in doing and in
bearing more than others: what every one else shrinks from through
aversion to labour or pain, they are attracted to, and go through with,
and so far (and so far only) they are a great people. At least, it
cannot be denied that they are a <em>pugnacious</em> set. Their heads are so
full of this, that if a Frenchman speaks of <span class='sc'>Scribe</span>, the celebrated
farce-writer, a young Englishman present will suppose he means Cribb
the boxer; and ten thousand people assembled at a prize-fight will
witness an exhibition of pugilism with the same breathless attention
and delight as the audience at the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théatre Français</span></i> listen to the
dialogue of Racine or Molière. Assuredly, <em>we</em> do not pay the same
attention to Shakspeare: but at a boxing-match every Englishman
feels his power to give and take blows increased by sympathy, as at a
French theatre every spectator fancies that the actors on the stage
talk, laugh, and make love as he would. A metaphysician might say,
that the English perceive objects chiefly by their mere material
qualities of solidity, inertness, and impenetrability, or by their own
muscular resistance to them; that they do not care about the colour,
taste, smell, the sense of luxury or pleasure:—they require the heavy,
hard, and tangible only, something for them to grapple with and
resist, to try their strength and their unimpressibility upon. They do
not like to smell to a rose, or to taste of made-dishes, or to listen to
soft music, or to look at fine pictures, or to make or hear fine speeches,
or to enjoy themselves or amuse others; but they will knock any man
down who tells them so, and their sole delight is to be as uncomfortable
and disagreeable as possible. To them the greatest labour is
to be pleased: they hate to have nothing to find fault with: to expect
them to smile or to converse on equal terms, is the heaviest tax you
can levy on their want of animal spirits or intellectual resources. A
drop of pleasure is the most difficult thing to extract from their hard,
dry, mechanical, husky frame; a civil word or look is the last thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>they can part with. Hence the <em>matter-of-factness</em> of their understandings,
their tenaciousness of reason or prejudice, their slowness to
distinguish, their backwardness to yield, their mechanical improvements,
their industry, their courage, their blunt honesty, their dislike
to the frivolous and florid, their love of liberty out of hatred to
oppression, and their love of virtue from their antipathy to vice.
Hence also their philosophy, from their distrust of appearances and
unwillingness to be imposed upon; and even their poetry has its
probable source in the same repining, discontented humour, which
flings them from cross-grained realities into the region of lofty and
eager imaginations.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a>—A French gentleman, a man of sense and wit,
expressed his wonder that all the English did not go and live in the
South of France, where they would have a beautiful country, a fine
climate, and every comfort almost for nothing. He did not perceive
that they would go back in shoals from this scene of fancied contentment
to their fogs and sea-coal fires, and that no Englishman can
live without something to complain of. Some persons are sorry to
see our countrymen abroad cheated, laughed at, quarrelling at all the
inns they stop at:—while they are in <em>hot-water</em>, while they think
themselves ill-used and have but the spirit to resent it, they are happy.
As long as they can swear, they are excused from being complimentary:
if they have to fight, they need not think: while they
are provoked beyond measure, they are released from the dreadful
obligation of being pleased. Leave them to themselves, and they are
dull: introduce them into company, and they are worse. It is the
incapacity of enjoyment that makes them sullen and ridiculous; the
mortification they feel at not having their own way in everything, and
at seeing others delighted without asking their leave, that makes them
haughty and distant. An Englishman is silent abroad from having
nothing to say; and he looks stupid, because he is so. It is kind
words and graceful acts that afflict his soul—an appearance of
happiness, which he suspects to be insincere because he cannot enter
into it, and a flow of animal spirits which dejects him the more from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>making him feel the want of it in himself; pictures that he does not
understand, music that he does not feel, love that he cannot make,
suns that shine out of England, and smiles more radiant than they!
Do not stifle him with roses: do not kill him with kindness: leave
him some pretext to grumble, to fret, and torment himself. Point at
him as he drives an English mail-coach about the streets of Paris or
of Rome, to relieve his despair of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> by affording him a pretence
to horsewhip some one. Be disagreeable, surly, lying, knavish,
impertinent out of compassion; insult, rob him, and he will thank
you; take any thing from him (nay even his life) sooner than his
opinion of himself and his prejudices against others, his moody
dissatisfaction and his contempt for every one who is not in as ill a
humour as he is.</p>

<p class='c000'>John Bull is certainly a singular animal. It is the being the beast
he is that has made a man of him. If he do not take care what he is
about, the same ungoverned humour will be his ruin. He must have
something to butt at; and it matters little to him whether it be friend
or foe, provided only he can <em>run-a-muck</em>. He must have a grievance
to solace him, a bugbear of some sort or other to keep himself in
breath: otherwise, he droops and hangs the head—he is no longer
John Bull, but John Ox, according to a happy allusion of the Poet-Laureate’s.
This necessity of John’s to be repulsive (right or wrong)
has been lately turned against himself, to the detriment of others, and
his proper cost. Formerly, the Pope, the Devil, the Inquisition, and
the Bourbons, served the turn, with all of whom he is at present
sworn friends, unless Mr. Canning should throw out a <em>tub to a whale</em>
in South America: then Bonaparte took the lead for awhile in John’s
panic-struck brain; and latterly, the Whigs and the <cite>Examiner</cite> newspaper
have borne the bell before all other topics of abuse and obloquy.
Formerly, liberty was the word with John,—now it has become a
bye-word. Whoever is not determined to make a slave and a drudge
of him, he defies, he sets at, he tosses in the air, he tramples under
foot; and after having mangled and crushed whom he pleases, stands
stupid and melancholy (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fænum in cornu</span></i>) over the lifeless remains of
his victim. When his fury is over, he repents of what he has done—too
late. In his tame fit, and having made a clear stage of all who
would or could direct him right, he is led gently by the nose by Mr.
Croker; and the ‘Stout Gentleman’ gets upon his back, making a
monster of him. Why is there a tablet stuck up in St. Peter’s at
Rome, to the memory of the three last of the Stuarts? Is it a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baisés mains</span></i> to the Pope, or a compromise with legitimacy? Is the
dread of usurpation become so strong, that a reigning family are half-ready
to acknowledge themselves usurpers, in favour of those who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>not likely to come back to assert their claim, and to countenance the
principles that may keep them on a throne, in lieu of the paradoxes
that placed them there? It is a handsome way of paying for a kingdom
with an epitaph, and of satisfying the pretensions of the living
and the dead. But we did not expel the slavish and tyrannical
Stuarts from our soil by the volcanic eruption of 1688, to send a
whining Jesuitical recantation and <em>writ of error</em> after them to the
other world a hundred years afterwards. But it may be said that the
inscription is merely a tribute of respect to misfortune. What! from
that quarter? No! it is a ‘lily-livered,’ polished, courtly, pious
monument to the fears that have so long beset the hearts of Monarchs,
to the pale apparitions of Kings dethroned or beheaded in time past
or to come (from that sad example) to the crimson flush of victory,
which has put out the light of truth, and to the reviving hope of that
deathless night of ignorance and superstition, when they shall once
more reign as Gods upon the earth, and make of their enemies their
footstool! Foreigners cannot comprehend this bear-garden work of
ours at all: they ‘perceive a fury, but nothing wherefore.’ They
cannot reconcile the violence of our wills with the dulness of our
apprehensions, nor account for the fuss we make about nothing; our
convulsions and throes without end or object, the pains we take to
defeat ourselves and others, and to undo all that we have ever done,
sooner than any one else should share the benefit of it. They think
it is strange, that out of mere perversity and contradiction we would
rather be slaves ourselves, than suffer others to be free; that we <em>back</em>
out of our most heroic acts and disavow our favourite maxims (the
blood-stained devices in our national coat of arms) the moment we find
others disposed to assent to or imitate us, and that we would willingly
see the last hope of liberty and independence extinguished, sooner than
give the smallest credit to those who sacrifice every thing to keep the
spark alive, or abstain from joining in every species of scurrility,
insult, and calumny against them, if the word is once given by the
whippers-in of power. The English imagination is not <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riante</span></i>: it
inclines to the gloomy and morbid with a heavy instinctive bias, and
when fear and interest are thrown into the scale, down it goes with a
vengeance that is not to be resisted, and from the effects of which it
is not easy to recover. The enemies of English liberty are aware of
this weakness in the public mind, and make a notable use of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had the good fortune to meet the other day at Paris with my old
fellow-student Dr. E——, after a lapse of thirty years; he is older
than I by a year or two, and makes it five-and-twenty. He had not
been idle since we parted. He sometimes looked in, after having
paid La Place a visit; and I told him it was almost as if he had
called on a star in his way. It is wonderful how friendship, that has
long lain unused, accumulates like money at compound interest. We
had to settle a long account, and to compare old times and new. He
was naturally anxious to learn the state of our politics and literature,
and was not a little mortified to hear that England, ‘whose boast it
was to give out reformation to the world,’ had changed her motto,
and was now bent on propping up the continental despotisms, and on
lashing herself to them. He was particularly mortified at the
degraded state of our public press—at the systematic organization of
a corps of government-critics to decry every liberal sentiment, and
proscribe every liberal writer as an enemy to the person of the reigning
sovereign, only because he did not avow the principles of the Stuarts.
I had some difficulty in making him understand the full lengths of the
malice, the lying, the hypocrisy, the sleek adulation, the meanness,
equivocation, and skulking concealment, of a <cite>Quarterly Reviewer</cite>,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>the reckless blackguardism of <cite>Mr. Blackwood</cite>, and the obtuse
drivelling profligacy of the <cite>John Bull</cite>. He said, ‘It is worse with
you than with us: here an author is obliged to sacrifice twenty
mornings and twenty pair of black silk-stockings, in paying his court
to the Editors of different journals, to ensure a hearing from the
public; but with you, it seems, he must give up his understanding and
his character, to establish a claim to taste or learning.’ He asked if
the scandal could not be disproved, and retorted on the heads of the
aggressors: but I said that these were persons of no character, or
studiously screened by their employers; and besides, the English
imagination was a bird of heavy wing, that, if once dragged through
the kennel of Billingsgate abuse, could not well raise itself out of it
again. He could hardly believe that under the Hanover dynasty (a
dynasty founded to secure us against tyranny) a theatrical licenser
had struck the word ‘tyrant’ out of Mr. Shee’s tragedy, as offensive
to ears polite, or as if from this time forward there could be supposed
to be no such thing in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rerum naturâ</span></i>; and that the common ejaculation,
‘Good God!’ was erased from the same piece, as in a strain of too
great levity in this age of cant. I told him that public opinion in
England was at present governed by half a dozen miscreants, who
undertook to bait, hoot, and worry every man out of his country, or
into an obscure grave, with lies and nicknames, who was not prepared
to take the political sacrament of the day, and use his best endeavours
(he and his friends) to banish the last traces of freedom, truth, and
honesty from the land. ‘To be direct and honest is not safe.’ To
be a Reformer, the friend of a Reformer, or the friend’s friend of a
Reformer, is as much as a man’s peace, reputation, or even life is
worth. Answer, if it is not so, pale shade of Keats, or living mummy
of William Gifford! Dr. E—— was unwilling to credit this statement,
but the proofs were too flagrant. He asked me what became
of that band of patriots that swarmed in <em>our</em> younger days, that were
so glowing-hot, desperate, and noisy in the year 1794? I said
I could not tell; but referred him to our present Poet-Laureate for
an account of them!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>I suspect it is peculiar to the English not to answer the letters of
their friends abroad. They know you are anxious to hear, and have
a surly, sullen pleasure in disappointing you. To oblige is a thing
abhorrent to their imaginations; to be uneasy at not hearing from
home just when one wishes, is a weakness which they cannot
encourage. Any thing like a responsibility attached to their writing
is a kind of restraint upon their free-will, an interference with their
independence. There is a sense of superiority in not letting you
know what you wish to know, and in keeping you in a state of helpless
suspense. Besides, they think you are angry at their not writing,
and would make them <em>if you could</em>; and they show their resentment
of your impatience and ingratitude by continuing not to write.—One
thing truly edifying in the accounts from England, is the number of
murders and robberies with which the newspapers abound. One
would suppose that the repetition of the details, week after week,
and day after day, might stagger us a little as to our superlative idea
of the goodness, honesty, and industry of the English people. No
such thing: whereas one similar fact occurring once a year abroad
fills us with astonishment, and makes us ready to <em>dub</em> the Italians
(without any further inquiry) a nation of assassins and banditti. It
is not safe to live or travel among them. Is it not strange, that we
should persist in drawing such wilful conclusions from such groundless
premises? A murder or a street-robbery in London is a matter of
course<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a>: accumulate a score of these under the most aggravated
circumstances one upon the back of the other, in town and country,
in the course of a few weeks—they all go for nothing; they make
nothing against the English character in the abstract; the force of
prejudice is stronger than the weight of evidence. The process of
the mind is this; and absurd as it appears, is natural enough. We
say (to ourselves) we are English, <em>we</em> are good people, and therefore
the English are good people. We carry a proxy in our bosoms for
the national character in general. Our own motives are ‘very stuff
o’ the conscience,’ and not like those of barbarous foreigners.
Besides, we know many excellent English people, and the mass of
the population cannot be affected in the scale of morality by the
outrages of a few ruffians, which instantly meet with the reward they
merit from wholesome and excellent laws. We are not to be
moved from this position, that the great body of the British public
do not live by thieving and cutting the throats of their neighbours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>whatever the accounts in the newspapers might lead us to suspect.
The streets are lined with bakers’, butchers’, and haberdashers’ shops,
instead of night-cellars and gaming-houses; and are crowded with
decent, orderly, well-dressed people, instead of being rendered
impassable by gangs of swindlers and pickpockets. <em>The exception does
not make the rule.</em> Nothing can be more clear or proper; and yet
if a single Italian commit a murder or a robbery, we immediately form
an abstraction of this individual case, and because we are ignorant of
the real character of the people or state of manners in a million of
instances, take upon us, like true Englishmen, to fill up the blank,
which is left at the mercy of our horror-struck imaginations, with
bugbears and monsters of every description. We should extend to
others the toleration and the suspense of judgment we claim; and I
am sure we stand in need of it from those who read the important
head of ‘<span class='sc'>Accidents and Offences</span>’ in our Journals. It is true an
Italian baker, some time ago, shut his wife up in an oven, where she
was burnt to death; the heir of a noble family stabbed an old woman
to rob her of her money; a lady of quality had her step-daughter
chained to a bed of straw, and fed on bread and water till she lost
her senses. This translated into vulgar English means that all the
bakers’ wives in Italy are burnt by their husbands at a slow fire;
that all the young nobility are common bravoes; that all the step-mothers
exercise unheard-of and unrelenting cruelty on the children
of a former marriage. We only want a striking frontispiece to make
out a tragic volume. As the traveller advances into the country,
robbers and rumours of robbers fly before him with the horizon. In

<p class='c000'>At Turin, they told me it was not wise to travel by a vetturino
to Florence without arms. At Florence, I was told one could not
walk out to look at an old ruin in Rome, without expecting to see
a Lazzaroni start from behind some part of it with a pistol in his
hand. ‘There’s no such thing;’ but hatred has its phantoms as
well as fear; and the English traduce and indulge their prejudices
against other nations in order to have a pretence for maltreating them.
This moral delicacy plays an under-game to their political profligacy.
I am at present kept from proceeding forward to Naples by <em>imaginary</em>
bands of brigands that infest the road the whole way. The fact is,
that a gang of banditti, who had committed a number of atrocities
and who had their haunts in the mountains near Sonino, were taken
up about three years ago, to the amount of two and thirty: four of
them were executed at Rome, and their wives still get their living
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>in this city by sitting as models to artists, on account of the handsomeness
of their features and the richness of their dresses. As to
courtesans, from which one cannot separate the name of Italy even
in idea, I have seen but one person answering to this description
since I came, and I do not even know that this was one. But I
saw a girl in white (an unusual thing) standing at some distance at
the corner of one of the bye-streets in Rome; after looking round
her for a moment, she ran hastily up the street again, as if in fear of
being discovered, and a countryman who was passing with a cart at
the time, stopped to look and hiss after her. If the draymen in
London were to stop to gape and hoot at all the girls they see standing
at the corners of streets in a doubtful capacity, they would have
enough to do. But the tide of public prostitution that pours down
all our streets is considered by some moralists as a drain to carry off
the peccant humours of private life, and to keep the inmost recesses
of the female breast sweet and pure from blemish! If this is to be
the test, we have indeed nearly arrived at the idea of a perfect
commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Cicisbeism</em> is still kept up in Italy, though somewhat on the decline.
I have nothing to say in favour of that anomaly in vice and virtue.
The English women are particularly shocked at it, who are allowed
to hate their husbands, provided they do not like any body else. It
is a kind of <em>marriage within a marriage</em>; it begins with infidelity to
end in constancy; it is not a state of licensed dissipation, but is a
real chain of the affections, superadded to the first formal one, and
that often lasts for life. A gay captain in the Pope’s Guard is
selected by a lady as her <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">cavalier servente</span></i> in the prime of life, and
is seen digging in the garden of the family in a grey jacket and white
hairs thirty years after. This does not look like a love of change.
The husband is of course always a <em>fixture</em>; not so the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cavalier servente</span></i>,
who is liable to be removed for a new favourite. In noble families
the lover must be noble; and he must be approved by the husband.
A young officer, who the other day volunteered this service to a
beautiful Marchioness without either of these titles, and was a sort
of interloper on the intended gallant, was sent to Volterra. Whatever
is the height to which this system has been carried, or the level
to which it has sunk, it does not appear to have extinguished jealousy
in all its excess as a part of the national character, as the following
story will shew: it is related by M. Beyle, in his charming little
work, entitled <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l’Amour</span></cite>, as a companion to the famous one in
Dante; and I shall give the whole passage in his words, as placing
the Italian character (in former as well as latter times) in a striking
point of view.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The woman who speaks with so much reserve, had in secret
undergone the fate of Desdemona, and had it in her power, by a
single word, to have revealed her husband’s crime to the friends
whom she had left upon earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Nello della Pietra obtained in marriage the hand of Madonna
Pia, sole heiress of the Ptolomei, the richest and most noble family
of Sienna. Her beauty, which was the admiration of all Tuscany,
gave rise to a jealousy in the breast of her husband, that, envenomed
by false reports and by suspicions continually reviving, led to a frightful
catastrophe. It is not easy to determine at this day if his wife
was altogether innocent; but Dante has represented her as such.
Her husband carried her with him into the marshes of Volterra,
celebrated then, as now, for the pestiferous effects of the air. Never
would he tell his unhappy wife the reason of her banishment into so
dangerous a place. His pride did not deign to pronounce either
complaint or accusation. He lived with her alone, in a deserted
tower, of which I have been to see the ruins on the sea-shore; here
he never broke his disdainful silence, never replied to the questions
of his youthful bride, never listened to her entreaties. He waited
unmoved by her for the air to produce its fatal effects. The vapours
of this unwholesome swamp were not long in tarnishing features the
most beautiful, they say, that in that age had appeared upon earth.
In a few months she died. Some chroniclers of these remote times
report, that Nello employed the dagger to hasten her end: she died
in the marshes in some horrible manner; but the mode of her death
remained a mystery, even to her contemporaries. Nello della Pietra
survived to pass the rest of his days in a silence which was never
broken.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Nothing can be conceived more noble or more delicate than the
manner in which the ill-fated Pia addresses herself to Dante. She
desires to be recalled to the memory of the friends whom she had
quitted so young: at the same time, in telling her name and alluding
to her husband, she does not allow herself the smallest complaint
against a cruelty unexampled, but thenceforth irreparable; and merely
intimates that he knows the history of her death. This constancy
in vengeance and in suffering is to be met with, I believe, only among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>the people of the South. In Piedmont, I found myself the
involuntary witness of a fact almost similar; but I was at the time
ignorant of the details. I was ordered with five-and-twenty dragoons
into the woods that border the Sesia, to prevent the contraband
traffic. On my arrival in the evening at this wild and solitary place,
I distinguished among the trees the ruins of an old castle: I went to
it: to my great surprise, it was inhabited. I there found a Nobleman
of the country, of a very unpromising aspect; a man six feet in
height, and forty years of age: he allowed me a couple of apartments
with a very ill grace. Here I entertained myself by getting up some
pieces of music with my quarter-master: after the expiration of some
days, we discovered that our host kept guard over a woman whom
we called Camilla in jest: we were far from suspecting the dreadful
truth. She died at the end of six weeks. I had the melancholy
curiosity to see her in her coffin; I bribed a monk who had charge
of it, and towards midnight, under pretext of sprinkling the holy
water, he conducted me into the chapel. I there saw one of those
fine faces, which are beautiful even in the bosom of death: she had
a large aquiline nose, of which I never shall forget the noble and
expressive outline. I quitted this mournful spot; but five years
after, a detachment of my regiment accompanying the Emperor to
his coronation as King of Italy, I had the whole story recounted to
me. I learned that the jealous husband, the Count of ——, had one
morning found, hanging to his wife’s bedside, an English watch
belonging to a young man in the little town where they lived. The
same day he took her to the ruined castle, in the midst of the forests
of the Sesia. Like Nello della Pietra, he uttered not a single word.
If she made him any request, he presented to her sternly and in
silence the English watch, which he had always about him. In this
manner he passed nearly three years with her. She at length fell a
victim to despair, in the flower of her age. Her husband attempted
to dispatch the owner of the watch with a stiletto, failed, fled to
Genoa, embarked there, and no tidings have been heard of him
since. His property was confiscated.’—<cite>De l’Amour</cite>, vol i. p. 131.</p>

<p class='c000'>This story is interesting and well told. One such incident, or
one page in Dante or in Spenser is worth all the route between this
and Paris, and all the sights in all the post-roads in Europe. Oh
Sienna! if I felt charmed with thy narrow, tenantless streets, or
looked delighted through thy arched gateway over the subjected
plain, it was that some recollections of Madonna Pia hung upon the
beatings of my spirit, and converted a barren waste into the regions
of romance!</p>

<p class='c008'>We had some thoughts of taking a lodging at L’Ariccia, at the Caffé
del Piazza, for a month, but the deep sandy roads, the centinels
posted every half-mile on this, which is the route for Naples (which
shewed that it was not very safe to leave them), the loose, straggling
woods sloping down to the dreary marshes, and the story of
Hippolitus painted on the walls of the inn (who, it seems, was
‘native to the manner here’), deterred us. L’Ariccia, besides
being, after Cortona, the oldest place in Italy, is also one step
towards Naples, which I had a strong desire to see—its brimming
shores, its sky which glows like one entire sun, Vesuvius, the mouth
of Hell, and Sorrentum, like the Islands of the Blest—yet here
again the reports of robbers, exaggerated alike by foreigners and
natives, who wish to keep you where you are, the accounts of hogs
without hair, and children without clothes to their backs, the vermin
(animal as well as human), the gilded hams and legs of mutton that
Forsyth speaks of, gave me a distaste to the journey, and I turned
back to put an end to the question. I am fond of the sun, though
I do not like to see him and the assassin’s knife glaring over my head
together. As to the real amount of the danger of travelling this
road, as far as I can learn, it is this—there is at present a possibility
but no probability of your being robbed or kidnapped, if you go in
the day-time and by the common method of a Vetturino, stopping two
nights on the road. If you go alone, and with a determination to
set time, place, and circumstances at defiance, like a personified
representation of John Bull, maintaining the character of your
countrymen for sturdiness and independence of spirit, you stand a
very good chance of being shot through the head: the same thing
might happen to you, if you refused your money to an English footpad;
but if you give it freely, like a gentleman, and do not stand too
nicely upon a punctilio, they let you pass like one. If you have no
money about you, you must up into the mountain, and wait till you
can get it. For myself, my remittances have not been very regular
even in walled towns; how I should fare in this respect upon the
forked mountain, I cannot tell, and certainly I have no wish to try.
A friend of mine said that he thought it <em>the only romantic thing going</em>,
this of being carried off by the banditti; that life was become too
tame and insipid without such accidents, and that it would not be
amiss to put one’s-self in the way of such an adventure, like putting
in for the grand prize in the lottery. Assuredly, one is not likely
to go to sleep in such circumstances: one person who was detained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>in this manner, and threatened every hour with being despatched,
went mad in consequence. A French Artist was laid hold of by a
gang of the outlaws, as he was sketching in the neighbourhood of
their haunts, about a year ago; he did not think their mode of life at
all agreeable. As he had no money, they employed him in making
sketches of their heads, with which they were exceedingly delighted.
Their vanity kept him continually on the alert when they had a
moment’s leisure; and, besides, he was fatigued almost to death, for
they made long marches of from forty to fifty miles a day, and scarcely
ever rested more than one night in the same place. They travelled
through bye-roads (in constant apprehension of the military) in parties
of five or six, and met at some common rendezvous at night-fall. He
was in no danger from them in the day-time; but at night they sat
up drinking and carousing, and when they were in this state of excitement,
he was in considerable jeopardy from their violence or sportive
freaks: they amused themselves with presenting their loaded pieces
at his breast, or threatened to dispatch him if he did not promise to
procure ransom. At last he effected his escape in one of their
drunken bouts. Their seizure of the Austrian officer last year was
singular enough: they crept for above a mile on their hands and
knees, from the foot of the mountain which was their place of retreat,
and carried off their prize in the same manner, so as to escape the
notice of the sentinels who were stationed at short distances on the
road side. Some years since a plan was laid to carry off Lucien
Buonaparte from his villa at Frascati, about eleven miles from Rome,
on the Albano side, where the same range of Apennines begins: he
was walking in his garden and saw them approaching through some
trees, for his glance is quick and furtive; he retired into the house,
his valet came out to meet them, who passed himself off for his
master, they were delighted with their sham-prize, and glad to take
4,000 crowns to release him. Since then Lucien Buonaparte has
lived in Rome. I remember once meeting this celebrated character
in the streets of Paris, walking arm in arm with Maria Cosway, with
whom I had drunk tea the evening before. He was dressed in a
light drab-coloured great-coat, and was then a spirited, dashing-looking
young man. I believe I am the only person in England who ever
read his <span class='sc'>Charlemagne</span>. It is as clever a poem as can be written by
a man who is not a poet. It came out in two volumes quarto, and
several individuals were applied to by the publishers to translate it;
among others Sir Walter Scott, who gave for answer, ‘that as to
Mister Buonaparte’s poem, he should have nothing to do with it.’
Such was the petty spite of this understrapper of greatness and of
titles, himself since titled, the scale of whose intellect can be equalled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>by nothing but the pitifulness and rancour of his prejudices! The
last account I have heard of the exploits of Neapolitan banditti is,
that they had seized upon two out of three Englishmen, who had
determined upon passing through Calabria on their way to Sicily, and
were proceeding beyond Pæstum for this purpose. They were told
by the Commandant there, that this was running into the lion’s
mouth, that there were no patrols to protect them farther, and that
they were sure to be intercepted; but an Englishman’s will is his
law—they went forward—and succeeded in getting themselves into
<em>the only remaining romantic situation</em>. I have not heard whether they
have yet got out of it. The national propensity to contend with
difficulty and to resist obstacles is curious, perhaps praiseworthy. A
young Englishman returned the other day to Italy with a horse that
he had brought with him for more than two thousand miles on the
other side of Grand Cairo; and poor Bowdich gave up the ghost in
a second attempt to penetrate to the source of the Niger, the encouragement
to persevere being in proportion to the impossibility of success!
I am myself somewhat effeminate, and would rather ‘the primrose
path of dalliance tread;’ or the height of my ambition in this line
would be to track the ancient route up the valley of the Simplon,
leaving the modern road (much as I admire the work and the workman),
and clambering up the ledges of rocks, and over broken bridges,
at the risk of a sprained ankle or a broken limb, to return to a late,
but excellent dinner at the post-house at Brigg!</p>

<p class='c000'>What increases the alarm of robbers in the South of Italy, is the
reviving of old stories, like the multiplication of echoes, and shifting
their dates indefinitely, so as to excite the fears of the listener, or
answer the purposes of the speaker. About three years ago, a
desperate gang of ruffians infested the passes of the Abruzzi, and
committed a number of atrocities; but this gang, to the amount of
about thirty, were seized and broken up, their ringleaders beheaded
in the Square di Popolo at Rome, and their wives or mistresses now
live there by sitting for their pictures to English artists. The
remainder figure as convicts in striped yellow and brown dresses in
the streets of Rome, and very civilly pull off their hats to strangers
as they pass. By the way, I cannot help reprobating this practice of
employing felons as common labourers in places of public resort.
Either you must be supposed to keep up your feelings of dislike and
indignation against them while thus mixing with the throng and
innocently employed, which is a disagreeable and forced operation of
the sense of justice; or if you retain no such feelings towards these
victims of the law, then why do they retain the chains on their feet
and ugly badges on their shoulders? If the thing is to be treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>seriously, it is painful: if lightly and good-humouredly, it turns the
whole affair into a farce or drama, with as little of the useful as the
pleasant in it. I know nothing of these people that I see manacled
and branded, but that they are labouring in a broiling sun for my convenience;
if one of them were to break loose, I should not care to
stop him. When we witness the punishments of individuals, we
should know their crimes; or at least their punishment and their
delinquency should not be mixed up indiscriminately with the ordinary
gaieties and business of human life. It is a chapter of the volume
that should be read apart! About six months ago, twenty-two
brigands came down from the mountains at Velletri, and carried off
four young women from the village. A Vetturino, who wished me
to return with him to Florence, spoke of this as having happened the
week before. There is a band of about ninety banditti scattered
through the mountains near Naples. Some years ago they were the
terror of travellers: at present they are more occupied in escaping
from the police themselves. But by thus confounding dates and
names, all parts of the road are easily filled all the year round with
nothing but robbers and rumours of robbers. In short, any one I
believe can pass with proper precaution from Rome to Naples and
back again, with tolerable, if not with absolute security. If he can
guard equally against petty thieving and constant imposition for the
rest of his route, it will be well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving Rome, we went to Tivoli, of which so much has
been said. The morning was bright and cloudless; but a thick mist
rose from the low, rank, marshy grounds of the Campagna, and
enveloped a number of curious objects to the right and left, till we
approached the sulphurous stream of Solfatara, which we could distinguish
at some distance by its noise and smell, and which crossing
the road like a blue ugly snake, infects the air in its hasty progress to
the sea. The bituminous lake from which it springs is about a mile
distant, and has the remains of an ancient temple on its borders.
Farther on is a round brick tower, the tomb of the Plautian family,
and Adrian’s villa glimmers with its vernal groves and nodding arches
to the right. In Rome, around it nothing strikes the eye, nothing
rivets the attention but ruins, the fragments of what has been; the
past is like a <em>halo</em> forever surrounding and obscuring the present!
Ruins should be seen in a desert, like those of Palmyra, and a pilgrimage
should be made to them; but who would take up his abode
among tombs? Or if there be a country and men in it, why have
they nothing to shew but the relics of antiquity, or why are the living
contented to crawl about like worms, or to hover like shadows in the
monuments of the dead? Every object he sees reminds the modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Roman that he is nothing—the spirits of former times overshadow
him, and dwarf his pigmy efforts: every object he sees reminds the
traveller that greatness is its own grave. Glory cannot last; for
when a thing is once done, it need not be done again, and with the
energy to act, a people lose the privilege <em>to be</em>. They repose upon
the achievements of their ancestors; and because every thing has been
done for them, sink into torpor, and dwindle into the counterfeits of
what they were. The Greeks will not recover their freedom till
they forget that they had ancestors, for nothing <em>is</em> twice because it
<em>was</em> once. The Americans will perhaps lose theirs, when they
begin fully to reap all the fruits of it; for the energy necessary to
acquire freedom, and the ease that follows the enjoyment of it, are
almost incompatible. If Italy should ever be any thing again, it will
be when the tokens of her former glory, pictures, statues, triumphal
arches are mouldered in the dust, and she has to re-tread the gradual
stages of civilization, from primeval barbarism to the topmost round
of luxury and refinement; or when some new light gives her a new
impulse; or when the last oppression (such as in all probability
impends over her) equally contrary to former independence, to
modern apathy, stinging her to the quick, once more kindles the fire
in her eye, and twines the deadly terrors on her brow. Then she
might have music in her streets, the dance beneath her vines,
inhabitants in her houses, business in her shops, passengers in her
roads, commerce on her shores, honesty in her dealings, openness in
her looks, books for the censorship, the love of right for the fear of
power, and a calculation of consequences from a knowledge of principles—and
England, like the waning moon, would grow pale in the
rising dawn of liberty, that she had in vain tried to tarnish and
obscure! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais assez des reflexions pour un voyageur.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>Tivoli is an enchanting—a fairy spot. Its rocks, its grottos, its
temples, its waterfalls, and the rainbows reflected on them, answer to
the description, and make a perfect play upon the imagination. Every
object is light and fanciful, yet steeped in classic recollections. The
whole is a fine net-work—a rare assemblage of intricate and high-wrought
beauties. To do justice to the scene would require the pen
of Mr. Moore, minute and striking as it is, sportive yet romantic,
displaying all the fascinations of sense, and unfolding the mysteries of
sentiment,</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>glittering like a sun-beam on the Sybil’s Temple at top, or darting on
a rapid antithesis to the dark grotto of the God beneath, loading the
prismatic spray with epithets, linking the meeting beauties on each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>side the abrupt, yawning chasm by an alliteration, painting the flowers,
pointing the rocks, passing the narrow bridge on a dubious metaphor,
and blending the natural and artificial, the modern and the antique,
the simple and the quaint, the glimmer and the gloom in an exquisite
profusion of fluttering conceits. He would be able to describe it
much better, with its tiny cascades and jagged precipices, than his
friend Lord Byron has described the Fall of Terni, who makes it,
without any reason that I can find, tortuous, dark, and boiling like a
witch’s cauldron. On the contrary, it is simple and majestic in its
character, a clear mountain-stream that pours an uninterrupted,
lengthened sheet of water over a precipice of eight hundred feet, in
perpendicular descent, and gracefully winding its way to the channel
beyond, while on one side the stained rock rises bare and stately the
whole height, and on the other, the gradual green woods ascend,
moistened by the ceaseless spray, and lulled by the roar of the
waterfall, as the ear enjoys the sound of famous poet’s verse. If
this noble and interesting object have a fault, it is that it is too
slender, straight, and accompanied with too few wild or grotesque
ornaments. It is the Doric, or at any rate the Ionic, among water-falls.
It has nothing of the texture of Lord Byron’s terzains,
twisted, zigzag, pent up and struggling for a vent, broken off at
the end of a line, or point of a rock, diving under ground, or out
of the reader’s comprehension, and pieced on to another stanza or
shelving rock.—Nature has</p>

<p class='c000'>To say the truth, if Lord Byron had put it into <cite>Don Juan</cite> instead of
<cite>Childe Harold</cite>, he might have compared the part which her ladyship
has chosen to perform on this occasion to an experienced waiter
pouring a bottle of ale into a tumbler at a tavern. It has somewhat
of the same continued, plump, right-lined descent. It is not frittered
into little parts, nor contrasted into quaintness, nor tortured into fury.
All the intricacy and contradiction that the noble Poet ascribes to
it belong to Tivoli; but then Tivoli has none of the grandeur or
violence of the description in <cite>Childe Harold</cite>. The poetry is fine, but
not like.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I have got so far on my way, I may as well jump the intermediate
space, and proceed with my statistics here, as there was
nothing on the road between this and Rome worth mentioning, except
Narni (ten miles from Terni), the approach to which overlooks a
fine, bold, woody, precipitous valley. We stopped at Terni for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>express purpose of visiting the Fall, which is four or five miles from
it. The road is excellent, and commands a succession of charming
points of view. You must pass the little village of Papinio, perched
like a set of pigeon-houses on the point of a rock about half-way up,
which has been battered almost in pieces by French, Austrians, and
others at different times, from a fort several hundred feet above it,
and that looks directly down upon the road. When you get to the
top of the winding ascent, and immediately before you turn off by a
romantic little path to the waterfall, you see the ranges of the Abruzzi
and the frozen top of the Pie de Lupo. Along this road the Austrian
troops marched three years ago to the support of good government
and social order at Naples. The prospect of the cold blue mountain-tops,
and other prospects which the sight of this road recalled, chilled
me, and I hastened down the side-path to lose, in the roar of the
Velino tumbling from its rocky height, and the wild freedom of
nature, my recollection of tyranny and tyrants. On a green bank far
below, so as to be just discernible, a shepherd-boy was sleeping under
the shadow of a tree, surrounded by his flock, enjoying peace and
freedom, scarce knowing their names. That’s something—we must
wait for the rest!</p>

<p class='c000'>We returned to the inn at Terni too late to proceed on our journey,
and were thrust, as a special favour, into a disagreeable apartment.
We had the satisfaction, however, to hear the united voices of the
passengers by two vetturinos, French and Italian men and women,
lifted up against the supper and wine as intolerably bad. The general
complaint was, that having paid so much for our fare, we were treated
like beggars—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme des gueux</span></i>. This was true enough, and not
altogether unreasonable. Let no one who can help it, and who
travels for pleasure, travel by a vetturino. You are treated much
in the same manner as if in England you went by the caravan
or the waggon. In fact, this mode of conveyance is an imposition
on innkeepers and the public. It is the result of a combination
among the vetturino owners, who bargain to provide you for a
certain sum, and then billet you upon the innkeepers for as little
as they can, who when thus obtruded upon them, under the
guarantee of a grasping stage-coach driver, consider you as common
property or prey, receive you with incivility, keep out of
the way, will not deign you an answer, stint you in the quantity of
your provisions, poison you by the quality, order you into their worst
apartments, force other people into the same room or even bed with
you, keep you in a state of continual irritation and annoyance all the
time you are in the house, and send you away jaded and dissatisfied
with your reception, and terrified at the idea of arriving at the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>place of refreshment, for fear of meeting with a renewal of the same
contemptible mortifications and petty insults. You have no remedy:
if you complain to the Vetturino, he says it is the fault of the innkeeper;
if you remonstrate with the innkeeper, he says he has orders
from the Vetturino only to provide certain things. It is of little use
to try to bribe the waiters; they doubt your word, and besides, do
not like to forego the privilege of treating a vetturino passenger as
one. It is best, if you travel in this manner, to pay for yourself;
and then you may stand some chance of decent accommodation. I
was foolish enough to travel twice in this manner, and pay three
Napoleons a day, for which I might have gone post, and fared in the
most sumptuous manner. I ought to add, in justice, that when I
have escaped from the guardianship of Monsieur le Vetturino and have
stopped at inns on my own account, as was the case at Venice, Milan,
and at Florence twice, I have no reason to complain either of the
treatment or the expence. As to economy, it is in vain to look for
it in travelling in Italy or at an hotel; and if you succeed in procuring
a private lodging for a time, besides the everlasting trickery and cabal,
you are likely to come off with very meagre fare, unless you can eat
Italian dishes. I ought, however, to repeat what I believe I have
said before, that the bread, butter, milk, wine and poultry that you
get here (even ordinarily) are excellent, and that you may also
obtain excellent tea and coffee.</p>

<p class='c000'>We proceeded next morning (in no very good humour) on our
way to Spoleto. The day was brilliant, and our road lay through
steep and narrow defiles for several hours. The sides of the hills on
each side were wild and woody; indeed, the whole ride was interesting,
and the last hill before we came to Spoleto, with a fine monastery
embosomed in its thick tufted trees, crowned our satisfaction with the
journey. Spoleto is a handsome town, delightfully situated, and has
an appearance (somewhat startling in Italy) as if life were not quite
extinct in it. It stands on the slope of a range of the Apennines,
extending as far as Foligno and Perugia, and ‘sees and is seen’ to a
great distance. From Perugia in particular (an interval of forty
miles) you seem as if you could put your hand upon it, so plain does
it appear, owing to the contrast between the white stone-houses, and
the dark pine-groves by which it is surrounded. The effect of this
contrast is not always pleasant. The single cottages or villas scattered
in the neighbourhood of towns in Italy, often look like dominos or
dice spread on a dark green cloth. We arrived at Foligno early in
the evening, and as a memorable exception to the rest of our route,
found there an inn equally clean and hospitable. From the windows
of our room we could see the young people of the town walking out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>in a fine open country, to breathe the clear fresh air, and the priests
sauntering in groups and enjoying the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">otium cum dignitate</span></i>. It was for
some monks of Foligno that Raphael painted his inimitable Madonna.</p>

<p class='c000'>We turned off at Assizi to view the triple Franciscan church and
monastery. We saw the picture of Christ (shewn by some nuns),
that used to smile upon St. Francis at his devotions; and the little
chapel in the plain below, where he preached to his followers six
hundred years ago, over which a large church is at present built, like
Popery surmounting Christianity. The church on the top of the hill,
built soon after his death in honour of the saint, and where his heart
reposes, is a curiosity in its kind. First, two churches were raised,
one on the top of the other, and then a third was added below with
some difficulty, by means of excavations in the rock. The last boasts
a modern and somewhat finical mausoleum or shrine, and the two
first are ornamented with fresco paintings by Giotto and Ghirlandaio,
which are most interesting and valuable specimens of the early history
of the art. I see nothing to contemn in them—much to admire—fine
heads, simple grouping, a knowledge of drawing and foreshortening,
and dignified attitudes and expressions, some of which Raphael has
not disdained to copy, though he has improved upon them. St.
Francis died about 1220, and this church was finished and ornamented
with these designs of the chief actions of his life, within forty months
afterwards; so that the pictures in question must be about six hundred
years old. We are not, however, to wonder at the maturity of these
productions of the pencil; the art did not arise out of barbarism or
nothing, but from a lofty preconception in the minds of those who
first practised it, and applied it to purposes of devotion. Even the
grace and majesty of Raphael were, I apprehend, but emanations of
the spirit of the Roman Catholic religion, and existed virtually in the
minds of his countrymen long before and after he transferred them,
with consummate skill, to the canvass. Not a Madonna scrawled on
the walls near Rome, not a baby-house figure of the Virgin, that is
out of character and costume, or that is not imbued with an expression
of resignation, benignity, and purity. We were shewn these different
objects by a young priest, who explained them to us with a gracefulness
of manner, and a mild eloquence, characteristic of his order. I
forgot to mention, in the proper place, that I was quite delighted with
the external deportment of the ecclesiastics in Rome. It was marked
by a perfect propriety, decorum, and humanity, from the highest to
the lowest. Not the slightest look or gesture to remind you that you
were foreigners or heretics—an example of civility that is far from
being superfluous, even in the capital of the Christian world. It may
be said that this is art, and a desire to gain upon the good opinion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>strangers. Be it so, but it must be allowed that it is calculated to
this end. Good manners have this advantage over good morals, that
they lie more upon the surface; and there is nothing, I own, that
inclines me to think so well of the understandings or dispositions of
others, as a thorough absence of all impertinence. I do not think <em>they</em>
can be the worst people in the world who habitually pay most attention
to the feelings of others; nor those the best who are endeavouring
every moment to hurt them. At Perugia, while looking at some
panels in a church painted by Pietro Perugino, we met with a young
Irish priest, who claimed acquaintance with us as country-folks, and
recommended our staying six days, to see the ceremonies and finery
attending the translation of the deceased head of his order from the
church where he lay to his final resting-place. We were obliged by
this proposal, but declined it. It was curious to hear English spoken
by the inmate of a Benedictine Monastery,—to see the manners of an
Italian priest engrafted on the Irish accent—to think that distant
countries are brought together by agreement in religion—that the
same country is rent asunder by differences in it. Man is certainly
an ideal being, whom the breath of an opinion wafts from Indus to the
Pole, and who is ready to sacrifice the present world and every object
in it for a reversion in the skies! Perugia is situated on a lofty hill,
and is in appearance the most solid mass of building I ever beheld.
It commands a most extensive view in all directions, and the ascent to
it is precipitous on every side. Travelling this road from Rome to
Florence is like an eagle’s flight—from hill-top to hill-top, from
towered city to city, and your eye devours your way before you over
hill or plain. We saw Cortona on our right, looking over its wall of
ancient renown, conscious of its worth, not obtruding itself on superficial
notice; and passed through Arezzo, the reputed birth-place of
Petrarch. All the way we were followed (hard upon) by another
Vetturino, with an English family, and we had a scramble whenever
we stopped for supper, beds, or milk. At Incisa, the last stage before
we arrived at Florence, an intimation was conveyed that we should
give up our apartments in the inn, and seek for lodgings elsewhere.
This modest proposition could come only from English people, who
have such an opinion of their dormant stock of pretended good-nature,
that they think all the world must in return be ready to give up their
own comforts to oblige them. We had two French gentlemen in the
coach with us, equally well-behaved and well-informed, and two
Italians in the cabriolet, as good-natured and ‘honest as the skin
between their brows.’ Near Perugia we passed the celebrated lake
of Thrasymene, near which Hannibal defeated the Roman consul
Flaminius. It struck me as not unlike Windermere in character and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>scenery, but I have seen other lakes since, which have driven it out
of my head. Florence (the city of flowers) seemed to deserve its
name as we entered it for the second time more than it did the first.
The weather had been cold during part of our journey, but now it
had changed to sultry heat. The people looked exceedingly plain
and hard-featured, after having passed through the Roman States.
They have the look of the Scotch people, only fiercer and more
ill-tempered.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p class='c008'>I have already described the road between Florence and Bologna.
I found it much the same on returning; for barren rocks and
mountains undergo little alteration either in summer or winter.
Indeed, of the two, I prefer the effect in the most dreary season, for
it is then most complete and consistent with itself: on some kinds of
scenery, as on some characters, any attempt at the gay and pleasing
sits ill, and is a mere piece of affectation. There is so far a distinction
between the Apennines and Alps, that the latter are often covered
with woods, and with patches of the richest verdure, and are capable
of all the gloom of winter or the bloom of spring. The soil of the
Apennines, on the contrary, is as dry and <em>gritty</em> as the rocks themselves,
being nothing but a collection of sand-heaps and ashes, and
mocks at every idea that is not of a repulsive and disagreeable kind.
We stopped the first night at Traversa, a miserable inn or almost
hovel on the road side, in the most desolate part of this track; and
found amidst scenes, which the imagination and the pen of travellers
have peopled with ghastly phantoms and the assassin’s midnight
revelry, a kind but simple reception, and the greatest sweetness of
manners, prompted by the wish, but conscious of being perhaps
without the means to please. Courtesy in cities or palaces goes for
little, means little, for it may and must be put on; in the cottage or
on the mountain-side it is welcome to the heart, for it comes from it.
It then has its root in unsophisticated nature, without the gloss of art,
and shews us the original goodness of the soil or germ, from which
human affections and social intercourse in all their ramifications
spring. A little boy clung about its mother, wondering at the
strangers; but from the very thoughts of novelty and distance,
nestling more fondly in the bosom of home. What is the map of
Europe, what all the glories of it, what the possession of them, to
that poor little fellow’s dream, to his sidelong glance at that wide
world of fancy that circles his native rocks!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>The second morning, we reached the last of the Apennines that
overlook Bologna, and saw stretched out beneath our feet a different
scene, the vast plain of Lombardy, and almost the whole of the North
of Italy, like a rich sea of boundless verdure, with towns and villas
spotting it like the sails of ships. A hazy inlet of the Adriatic
appeared to the right (probably the Gulph of Comachio). We
strained our eyes in vain to catch a doubtful view of the Alps, but
they were still sunk below the horizon. We presently descended
into this plain (which formed a perfect contrast to the country we had
lately passed), and it answered fully to the promise it had given us.
We travelled for days, for weeks through it, and found nothing but
ripeness, plenty, and beauty. It may well be called the Garden of
Italy or of the World. The whole way from Bologna to Venice,
from Venice to Milan, it is literally so. But I anticipate.—We
went to our old inn at Bologna, which we liked better the second
time than the first; and had just time to snatch a glimpse of the
Guidos and Domenichinos at the Academy, which gleamed dark and
beautiful through the twilight. We set out early the next morning
on our way to Venice, turning off to Ferrara. It was a fine spring
morning. The dew was on the grass, and shone like diamonds in
the sun. A refreshing breeze fanned the light-green odorous branches
of the trees, which spread their shady screen on each side of the road,
which lay before us as straight as an arrow for miles. Venice was at
the end of it; Padua, Ferrara, midway. The prospect (both to the
sense and to the imagination) was exhilarating; and we enjoyed it
for some hours, till we stopped to breakfast at a smart-looking
detached inn at a turning of the road, called, I think, the <em>Albergo di
Venezia</em>. This was one of the pleasantest places we came to during
the whole of our route. We were shewn into a long saloon, into
which the sun shone at one extremity, and we looked out upon the
green fields and trees at the other. There were flowers in the room.
An excellent breakfast of coffee, bread, butter, eggs, and slices of
Bologna sausages was served up with neatness and attention. An
elderly female, thin, without a cap, and with white thread-stockings,
watched at the door of a chamber not far from us, with the patience
of an eastern slave. The door opened, and a white robe was handed
out, which she aired carefully over a chaffing-dish with mechanical
indifference, and an infinite reduplication of the same folds. It was
our young landlady who was dressing for church within, and who at
length issued out, more remarkable for the correctness of her costume
than the beauty of her person. Some rustics below were playing at
a game, that from the incessant loud jarring noises of counting that
accompanied it, implied equally good lungs and nerves in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>performers and by-standers. At the tinkling of a village bell, all was
in a moment silent, and the entrance of a little chapel was crowded
with old and young, kneeling in postures of more or less earnest
devotion. We walked forward, delighted with the appearance of the
country, and with the simple manners of the inhabitants; nor could
we have proceeded less than four or five miles along an excellent
footpath, but under a broiling sun, before we saw any signs of our
Vetturino, who was willing to take this opportunity of easing his
horses—a practice common with those sort of gentry. Instead of a
fellow-feeling with you, you find an instinctive inclination in persons
of this class all through Italy to cheat and deceive you: the more
easy or cordial you are with them, the greater is their opinion of your
folly and their own cunning, and the more are they determined to
repel or evade any advances to a fair understanding: threaten, or
treat them with indignity, and you have some check over them; relax
the reins a moment, and they are sure to play you some scurvy trick.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Ferrara we were put on short allowance, and as we found
remonstrance vain, we submitted in silence. We were the more
mortified at this treatment, as we had begun to hope for better things;
but Mr. Henry Waister, our Commissary on the occasion, was determined
to make a good thing of his three Napoleons a-day; he had
strained a point in procuring us a tolerable supper and breakfast at the
two last stages, which must serve for some time to come; and as he
would not pay for our dinner, the landlord would not let us have one,
and there the matter rested. We walked out in the evening, and
found Ferrara enchanting. Of all the places I have seen in Italy,
it is the one by far I should most covet to live in. It is the
<em>ideal</em> of an Italian city, once great, now a shadow of itself. Whichever
way you turn, you are struck with picturesque beauty and
faded splendours, but with nothing squalid, mean, or vulgar. The
grass grows in the well-paved streets. You look down long avenues
of buildings, or of garden walls, with summer-houses or fruit-trees
projecting over them, and airy palaces with dark portraits gleaming
through the grated windows—you turn, and a chapel bounds your
view one way, a broken arch another, at the end of the vacant,
glimmering, fairy perspective. You are in a dream, in the heart of
a romance; you enjoy the most perfect solitude, that of a city which
was once filled with ‘the busy hum of men,’ and of which the
tremulous fragments at every step strike the sense, and call up reflection.
In short, nothing is to be seen of Ferrara, but the remains,
graceful and romantic, of what it was—no sordid object intercepts
or sullies the retrospect of the past—it is not degraded and patched
up like Rome, with upstart improvements, with earthenware and oil-shops;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>it is a classic vestige of antiquity, drooping into peaceful decay,
a sylvan suburb—</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Ariosto lived—here Tasso occupied first a palace, and then a
dungeon. Verona has even a more sounding name; boasts a finer
situation, and contains the tomb of Juliet. But the same tender
melancholy grace does not hang upon its walls, nor hover round its
precincts as round those of Ferrara, inviting to endless leisure and
pensive musing. Ferrara, while it was an independent state, was a
flourishing and wealthy city, and contained 70,000 inhabitants; but
from the time it fell into the hands of the Popes, in 1597, it
declined, and it has now little more than an historical and poetical
being.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Ferrara we proceeded through Rovigo to Padua <em>the Learned</em>,
where we were more fortunate in our inn, and where, in the fine open
square at the entrance, I first perceived the rage for vulgar and
flaunting statuary, which distinguishes the Lombardo-Venetian States.
The traveller to Venice (who goes there to see the masterpieces of
Titian or Palladio’s admired designs), runs the gauntlet all the way
along at every town or villa he passes, of the most clumsy, affected,
paltry, sprawling figures, cut in stone, that ever disgraced the chisel.
Even their crucifixes and common Madonnas are in bad taste and
proportion. This inaptitude for the representation of forms in a
people, whose eye for colours transcended that of all the world besides,
is striking as it is curious: and it would be worth the study of a man’s
whole life to give a true and satisfactory solution of the mystery.
Padua, though one of the oldest towns in Italy, is still a place
of some resort and bustle; among other causes, from the number of
Venetian families who are in the habit of spending the summer months
there. Soon after leaving it, you begin to cross the canals and rivers
which intersect this part of the country bordering upon the sea, and
for some miles you follow the course of the Brenta along a flat, dusty,
and unprofitable road. This is a period of considerable and painful
suspense, till you arrive at Fusina, where you are put into a boat and
rowed down one of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lagunes</span></i>, where over banks of high rank grass
and reeds, and between solitary sentry-boxes at different intervals, you
see Venice rising from the sea. For an hour and a half, that it takes
you to cross from the last point of land to this Spouse of the Adriatic,
its long line of spires, towers, churches, wharfs is stretched along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>water’s edge, and you view it with a mixture of awe and incredulity.
A city built in the air would be something still more wonderful; but
any other must yield the palm to this for singularity and imposing
effect. If it were on the firm land, it would rank as one of the first
cities in Europe for magnificence, size, and beauty; as it is, it is
without a rival. I do not know what Lord Byron and Lady Morgan
could mean by quarrelling about the question who first called Venice
‘the Rome of the sea’—since it is perfectly unique in its kind. If
a parallel must be found for it, it is more like Genoa shoved into the
sea. Genoa stands <em>on</em> the sea, this <em>in</em> it. The effect is certainly
magical, dazzling, perplexing. You feel at first a little giddy: you
are not quite sure of your footing as on the deck of a vessel. You
enter its narrow, cheerful canals, and find that instead of their being
scooped out of the earth, you are gliding amidst rows of palaces and
under broad-arched bridges, piled on the sea-green wave. You begin
to think that you must cut your liquid way in this manner through
the whole city, and use oars instead of feet. You land, and visit
quays, squares, market-places, theatres, churches, halls, palaces;
ascend tall towers, and stroll through shady gardens, without being
once reminded that you are not on <em>terra firma</em>. The early inhabitants
of this side of Italy, driven by Attila and his hordes of
Huns from the land, sought shelter in the sea, built there for safety
and liberty, laid the first foundations of Venice in the rippling wave,
and commerce, wealth, luxury, arts, and crimson conquest crowned
the growing Republic;—</p>

<p class='c000'>Man, proud of his amphibious creation, spared no pains to aggrandize
and embellish it, even to extravagance and excess. The piles and
blocks of wood on which it stands are brought from the huge forests
at Treviso and Cadore: the stones that girt its circumference, and
prop its walls, are dug from the mountains of Istria and Dalmatia:
the marbles that inlay its palace-floors are hewn from the quarries
near Verona. Venice is loaded with ornament, like a rich city-heiress
with jewels. It seems the natural order of things. Her
origin was a wonder: her end is to surprise. The strong, implanted
tendency of her genius must be to the showy, the singular, the
fantastic. Herself an anomaly, she reconciles contradictions, liberty
with aristocracy, commerce with nobility, the want of titles with the
pride of birth and heraldry. A violent birth in nature, she lays
greedy, perhaps ill-advised, hands on all the artificial advantages that
can supply her original defects. Use turns to gaudy beauty; extreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>hardship to intemperance in pleasure. From the level uniform
expanse that forever encircles her, she would obviously affect the
aspiring in forms, the quaint, the complicated, relief and projection.
The richness and foppery of her architecture arise from this: its
stability and excellence probably from another circumstance counteracting
this tendency to the buoyant and fluttering, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, the necessity
of raising solid edifices on such slippery foundations, and of not
playing tricks with stone-walls upon the water. Her eye for colours
and costume she would bring with conquest from the East. The
spirit, intelligence, and activity of her men, she would derive from
their ancestors: the grace, the glowing animation and bounding step
of her women, from the sun and mountain-breeze! The want of
simplicity and severity in Venetian taste seems owing to this, that all
here is factitious and the work of art: redundancy again is an
attribute of commerce, whose eye is gross and large, and does not
admit of the <em>too much</em>; and as to irregularity and want of fixed
principles, we may account by analogy at least for these, from that
element of which Venice is the nominal bride, to which she owes her
all, and the very essence of which is caprice, uncertainty, and
vicissitude!</p>

<p class='c000'>This, which is a description of a dream of Babylon of old, by a living
poet, is realized almost literally in modern Venice.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<p class='c008'>I never saw palaces anywhere but at Venice. Those at Rome are
dungeons compared to them. They generally come down to the
water’s edge, and as there are canals on each side of them, you see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>them <em>four-square</em>. The views by Canaletti are very like, both for the
effect of the buildings and the hue of the water. The principal are
by Palladio, Longhena, and Sansovino. They are massy, elegant,
well-proportioned, costly in materials, profuse of ornament. Perhaps
if they were raised above the water’s edge on low terraces (as some
of them are), the appearance of comfort and security would be
greater, though the architectural daring, the poetical miracle would
appear less. As it is, they seem literally to be suspended in the
water.—The richest in interior decoration that I saw, was the
Grimani Palace, which answered to all the imaginary conditions of
this sort of thing. Aladdin might have exchanged his for it, and
given his lamp into the bargain. The floors are of marble, the
tables of precious stones, the chairs and curtains of rich silk, the
walls covered with looking-glasses, and it contains a cabinet of invaluable
antique sculpture, and some of Titian’s finest portraits. I
never knew the practical amount to the poetical, or furniture seem to
grow eloquent but in this instance. The rooms were not too large
for comfort neither; for space is a consideration at Venice. All
that it wanted of an Eastern Palace was light and air, with distant
vistas of hill and grove. A genealogical tree of the family was hung
up in one of the rooms, beginning with the founder in the ninth
century, and ending with the present representative of it; and one of
the portraits, by Titian, was of a Doge of the family, looking just
like an ugly, spiteful old woman; but with a truth of nature, and a
force of character that no one ever gave but he. I saw no other
mansion equal to this. The Pisani is the next to it for elegance and
splendour; and from its situation on the Grand Canal, it admits a
flood of bright day through glittering curtains of pea-green silk, into
a noble saloon, enriched with an admirable family-picture by Paul
Veronese, with heads equal to Titian for all but the character of
thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Close to this is the Barberigo Palace, in which Titian lived, and
in which he died, with his painting-room just in the state in which he
left it. It is hung round with pictures, some of his latest works,
such as the Magdalen and the Salvator Mundi (which are common in
prints), and with an unfinished sketch of St. Sebastian, on which he
was employed at the time of his death. Titian was ninety-nine when
he died, and was at last carried off by the plague. My guide
who was enthusiastic on the subject of Venetian art, would not allow
any falling-off in these latest efforts of his mighty pencil, but represented
him as prematurely cut off in the height of his career. He
knew, he said, an old man, who had died a year ago, at one hundred
and twenty. The Venetians may still live to be old, but they do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>paint like Titian! The Magdalen is imposing and expressive, but
the colouring is tinted (quite different from Titian’s usual simplicity)
and it has a flaccid, meretricious, affectedly lachrymose appearance,
which I by no means like. There is a slabbery freedom or a stiff
grandeur about most of these productions, which, I think, savoured of
an infirm hand and eye, accompanied with a sense of it. Titian, it is
said, thought he improved to the last, and wished to get possession of
his former pictures, to paint them over again, upon broader and more
scientific principles, as some authors have wished to re-write their
works: there was a small model of him in wax, done by a contemporary
artist in his extreme old age, shewn in London a year or
two ago, with the black velvet cap, the green gown, and a white
sleeve appearing from under it, against a pale, shrivelled hand. The
arrangement of colouring was so truly characteristic, that it was
probably dictated by himself. It may be interesting to artists to be
told, that the room in the Barberigo Palace (said to be his painting-room)
has nearly a southern aspect. There are some other indifferent
pictures hanging in the room, by painters before his time, probably
some that he had early in his possession, and kept longest for that
reason. It is an event in one’s life to find one’s-self in Titian’s
painting-room. Yet it did not quite answer to my expectations—a
hot sun shone into the room, and the gondola in which we came
was unusually close—neither did I stoop and kiss the stone which
covers his dust, though I have worshipped him on this side of
idolatry!</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the inscription on his tomb in the church of the Frati. I
read it twice over, but it would not do. Why grieve for the
immortals? One is not exactly one’s-self on such occasions, and
enthusiasm has its intermittent and stubborn fits; besides, mine is, at
present, I suspect, a kind of July shoot, that must take its rise from the
stock of former impressions. It spread aloft on the withered branches
of the St. Peter Martyr, and shot out more kindly still from
seeing three pictures of his, close together, at the house of Signor
Manfrini (a Venetian tobacconist), an elaborate Portrait of his friend
Ariosto—sharp-featured and tawny-coloured, with a light Morisco
look—a bronzed duplicate of the Four Ages at the Marquess of
Stafford’s—and his Mistress (which is in the Louvre) introduced
into a composition with a gay cavalier and a page. I was glad to see
her in company so much fitter for her than her old lover; and
besides, the varied grouping gave new life and reality to this charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>vision. The two last pictures are doubtfully ascribed to
Giorgioni, and this critical equivoque was a source of curiosity and
wonder. Giorgioni is the only painter with respect to whom this
could be made a question (the distinction between Titian and the
other painters of the Venetian school, Tintoret and Paul Veronese,
is broad and palpable enough)—and for myself, I incline to attribute
the last of the three <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvres</span></i> above enumerated to Giorgioni.
The difference, it appears to me, may be thus stated. There is more
glow and animation in Giorgioni than in Titian. He is of a franker and
more genial spirit. Titian has more subtilty and meaning, Giorgioni
more life and youthful blood. The feeling in the one is suppressed;
in the other, it is overt and transparent. Titian’s are set portraits,
with the smallest possible deviation from the straight line: they look as
if they were going to be shot, or to shoot somebody. Giorgioni, in
what I have seen of his pictures, as the Gaston de Foix, the Music-piece
at Florence, &amp;c. is full of inflection and contrast; there is
seldom a particle of it in Titian. An appearance of silence, a
tendency to still-life, pervades Titian’s portraits; in Giorgioni’s there
is a bending attitude, and a flaunting air, as if floating in gondolas or
listening to music. For all these reasons (perhaps slenderly put
together) I am disposed to think the portrait of the young man in
the picture alluded to is by Giorgioni, from the flushed cheek, the
good-natured smile, and the careless attitude; and for the same reason,
I think it likely that even the portrait of the lady is originally his,
and that Titian copied and enlarged the design into the one we see
in the Louvre, for the head (supposed to be of himself, in the background)
is middle-aged, and Giorgioni died while Titian was yet
young. The question of priority in this case is a very nice one;
and it would be curious to ascertain the truth by tradition or private
documents of any kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>I teazed my <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">valet de place</span></i> (Mr. Andrew Wyche, a Tyrolese, a
very pleasant, companionable, and patriotic sort of person) the whole
of the first morning at every fresh landing or embarkation by asking,
‘But are we going to see the Saint Peter Martyr?’ When we
reached the Church of Saint John and Saint Paul, the light did not
serve, and we got reprimanded by the priest for turning our backs on
the host, in our anxiety to find a proper point of view. We returned
to the charge at five in the afternoon, when the light fell upon it
through a high-arched Gothic window, and it came out in all its
pristine glory, with its rich, embrowned, overshadowing trees, its
nobly-drawn heroic figures, its blood-stained garments, its flowers and
trailing plants, and that cold convent-spire rising in the distance
amidst the sapphire mountains and the golden sky. I found every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>thing in its place and as I expected. Yet I am unwilling to say that
I saw it through my former impressions: this picture suffices to
itself, and fills the mind without an effort; for it contains all the
mighty world of landscape and history, grandeur and breadth of form
with the richest depth of colouring, an expression characteristic,
powerful, that cannot be mistaken, conveying the scene at the
moment, a masterly freedom and unerring truth of execution, and a
subject as original as it is stately and romantic. It is the foremost of
Titian’s productions, and exhibits the most extraordinary specimen
of his varied powers. Most probably, as a picture, it is the finest in
the world; or if I cannot say it is the picture which I would the
soonest have painted, it is at least the one which I would the soonest
have. It is a rich feast to the eye, ‘where no crude surfeit reigns.’
As an instance of the difference between Titian and Raphael, you
here see the figures from below, and they stand out with noble
grandeur of effect against the sky; Raphael would have buried them
under the horizon, or stuck them against the landscape, without relief
or motion. So much less knowledge had he of the picturesque!
Again, I do not think Raphael could have given the momentary
expression of sudden, ghastly terror, or the hurried, disorderly
movements of the flying Monk, or the entire prostration of the other
(like a rolling ruin) so well as Titian. The latter could not, I
know, raise a sentiment to its height like the former; but Raphael’s
expressions and attitudes were (so to speak) the working out of ‘foregone
conclusions,’ not the accidental fluctuations of mind or matter—were
final and fixed,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> not salient or variable. I observed, in looking
closer, that the hinder or foreshortened leg of the flying monk
rests upon the edge of a bank of earth, from which he is descending.
This explains the action of the part better, but I doubt whether this
idea of inequality and interruption from the broken nature of the
ground is an addition to the feeling of precipitate fear and staggering
perplexity in the mind of the person represented. This may be an
hypercriticism. The colouring of the foremost leg of this figure is
sufficient to prove that the utter paleness of the rest of it is from its
having faded in the course of time. The colour of the face in this
and the other monk is the same as it was twenty years ago; it has
sustained no injury in that time. But for the sun-burnt, well-baked,
robust tone of the flesh-colour, commend me to the leg and girded
thigh of the robber. What a difference between this and Raphael’s
brick-dust!—I left this admirable performance with regret; yet I do
not see why; for I have it present with me, ‘in my mind’s eye,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and swear, in the wildest scenes of the Alps, that the St. Peter
Martyr is finer. That, and the Man in the Louvre, are my standards
of perfection; my taste may be wrong; nay, even ridiculous—yet
such it is.</p>

<p class='c000'>The picture of the Assumption, at the Academy of Painting at
Venice, which was discovered but the other day under a load of dirt
and varnish, is cried up as even superior to the St. Peter: it is indeed
a more extraordinary picture for the artist to have painted; but for
that very reason it is neither so perfect nor so valuable. Raphael
could not paint landscape; Titian could hardly paint history without
the help of landscape. A background was necessary to him, like
music to a melodrame. He had in this picture attempted the style of
Raphael, and has succeeded and even failed—to admiration. He
has given the detached figures of the Roman school, the contrasted,
uniform colours of their draperies, the same determined outline, no
breaking of the colours or play of light and shade, and has aimed at
the same elevation and force of expression. The drawing has
nearly the same firmness with more scope, the colouring is richer and
almost as hard, the attitudes are imposing and significant, and the
features handsome—what then is wanting? That glow of heavenward
devotion bent on ideal objects, and taking up its abode in the
human form and countenance as in a shrine; that high and abstracted
expression, that outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible
grace, which Raphael alone could give in its utmost purity and
intensity. One glimpse of the Crowning of the Virgin in the Vatican
is worth it all—lifts the mind nigher to the subject, dissolves it in
greater sweetness, sinks it in deeper thoughtfulness. The eager
headlong enthusiasm of the Apostle to the right in a green mantle is
the best; the lambent eyes and suffused glow of the St. John are
only the indications of rosy health, and youthful animation; the
Virgin is a well-formed rustic beauty with a little affectation, and the
attitude of the Supreme Being is extravagant and distorted. Raphael
could have painted this subject, as to its essential qualities, better;
he could not have done the St. Peter Martyr in any respect so well.
I like Titian’s Martyrdom of St. Lawrence (notwithstanding the
horror of the subject) better than the Assumption, for its characteristic
expression, foreshortening, and fine mellow masses of light and
shade. Titian could come nearer the manner of Michael Angelo
than that of Raphael, from an eye for what was grand and impressive
in outward form and position, as his frescoes of Prometheus,
Cain and Abel, and another grotesque and gigantic subject on the
ceiling of one of the churches, shew. These, in picturesque grouping,
in muscular relief, and vastness of contour, surpass Michael
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Angelo’s figures in the Last Judgment, however they may fall short
of them in anatomical knowledge or accuracy. I also was exceedingly
delighted with the Salutation of the Virgin at the Academy,
which is shewn as one of his masterpieces, for the mixture of airy
scenic effect with the truth of individual portraiture. The churches
and public buildings here bear ample testimony to the powers of
Titian’s historic pencil, though I did not see enough of his portraits in
private collections, of which I had hoped to take my fill. In the large
hall of the Academy of Painting are also the fine picture of the Miracle
of Saint Mark by Tintoret, an inimitable representation of a religious
and courtly ceremony by Paris Bourbon (inimitable for the light,
rich, gauze-colouring, and magical effect of the figures in perspective),
and several others of vast merit as well as imposing dimensions.
The Doge’s Palace and the Council-Chamber of the Senate are
adorned with the lavish performances of Tintoret and Paul Veronese;
and in the allegorical figures in the ceiling of the Council-Chamber, and
in the splendid delineation of a Doge returning thanks to the Virgin
for some victory over the Infidels, which occupies the end of it, I
think the last-named painter has reached the top of his own and
of Venetian art. As an art of decoration, addressing itself to the
eye, to the vain or voluptuous part of our constitution, it cannot be
carried farther. Of all pictures this Thanksgiving is the most
dazzling, the most florid. A rainbow is not more rich in hues, a
bubble that glitters in the sun is not more light and glossy, a bed of
tulips is not more gaudy. A flight of angels with rosy hues and
winged glories connects the heavenly and the earthly groups like a
garland of blushing flowers. The skill and delicacy of this composition
is equal to its brilliancy of effect. His marriage of Cana
(another wonderful performance) is still at Paris: it was formerly in
the Refectory of the church of St. Giorgio Maggiore, on an island on
the opposite side of the harbour, which is well worth attention for the
architecture by Palladio and the altar-piece in bronze by John of
Bologna, containing a number of figures (as it appears to me) of the
most masterly design and execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have thus hastily run through what struck me as most select
in fine art in this celebrated city. To enumerate every thing would
be endless. There are other objects for the curious. The Mosaics
of the church of St. Mark, the Brazen Horses, the belfry or
Campanile, the arsenal, and the theatres, which are wretched both
as it relates to the actors and the audience. The shops are
exceedingly neat and well-stocked, and the people gay and spirited.
The harbour does not present an appearance of much traffic. In the
times of the Republic, 30,000 people are said to have slept every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>night in the vessels in the bay. Daniell’s Hotel, at which we were,
and to which I would recommend every English traveller, commands
a superb view of it, and the scene (particularly by moonlight) is
delicious. I heard no music at Venice, neither voice nor lute;
saw no group of dancers or maskers, and the gondolas appear to me
to resemble hearses more than pleasure-boats. I saw the Rialto,
which is no longer an Exchange. The Bridge of Sighs, of which
Lord Byron speaks, is not a thoroughfare, but an arch suspended at
a considerable height over one of the canals, and connecting the
Doge’s palace with the prison.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<p class='c008'>We left Venice with mingled satisfaction and regret. We had to
retrace our steps as far as Padua, on our way to Milan. For four
days’ journey, from Padua to Verona, to Brescia, to Treviglio, to
Milan, the whole way was cultivated beauty and smiling vegetation.
Not a rood of land lay neglected, nor did there seem the smallest
interruption to the bounty of nature or the industry of man. The
constant verdure fatigued the eye, but soothed reflection. For miles
before you, behind you, and on each side, the trailing vines hung
over waving corn-fields, or clear streams meandered through rich
meadow-grounds, and pastures. The olive we had nearly left
behind us in Tuscany, and were not sorry to part with its half-mourning
appearance amidst more luxuriant scenes and various
foliage. The country is quite level, and the roads quite straight for
nearly four hundred miles that we had travelled after leaving
Bologna; and every foot or acre of this immense plain is wrought
up to a pitch of neatness and productiveness, equal to that of a
gentleman’s kitchen-garden, or to the nursery-grounds in the
neighbourhood of London. A gravel-pit or a furze-bush by the
roadside is a relief to the eye. There is no perceptible difference
in approaching the great towns, though their mounds of green earth
and the mouldering remains of fortifications give an agreeable and
romantic variety to the scene; the whole of the intermediate space
is literally, and without any kind of exaggeration, one continued and
delightful garden. Whether this effect is owing to the felicity
of the soil and climate, or to the art of man, or to former good
government, or to all these combined, I shall not here inquire; but
the fact is so, and it is sufficient to put an end to the idea that there
is neither industry nor knowledge of agriculture nor plenty out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>England, and to the common proverbial cant about the sloth and
apathy of the Italians, as if they would not lift the food to their
mouths, or gather the fruits that are drooping into them. If the
complaints of the poverty and wretchedness of Italy are confined to
the Campagna of Rome, or to some districts of the Apennines,
I have nothing to say; but if a sweeping conclusion is drawn from
these to Italy in general, or to the North of it in particular, I must
enter my protest against it. Such an inference is neither philosophical,
nor, I suspect, patriotic. The English are too apt to take
every opportunity, and to seize on every pretext for treating the rest
of the world as wretches—a tone of feeling which does not exactly
tend to enhance our zeal in the cause either of liberty or humanity.
If people are wretches, the next impression is that they deserve to
be so; and we are thus prepared to lend a helping hand to make
them what we say they are. The Northern Italians are as fine a
race of people as walk the earth; and all that they want, to be what
they once were, or that any people is capable of becoming, is neither
English abuse nor English assistance, but three words spoken to the
other powers; ‘Let them alone!’ But England, in the dread that
others should follow her example, has quite forgotten what she
herself once was. Another idea that the aspect of this country
and of the country-people suggests, is the fallacy of some of Mr.
Malthus’s theories. The soil is here cultivated to the greatest
possible degree, and yet it seems to lead to no extraordinary excess
of population. Plenty and comfort abound; but they are not
accompanied by an appearance of proportionable want and misery,
tracking them at the heels. The present generation of farmers and
peasants seem well of; the last, probably, were so: this circumstance,
therefore, does not appear to have given any overweening presumptuous
activity, or headstrong impulse to the principle of population,
nor to have determined those fortunate possessors of a land flowing
with milk and honey, from an acquaintance with the good things of
this life, to throw all away at one desperate cast, and entail famine,
disease, vice, and misery on themselves and their immediate
descendants. It is not, however, my intention to enter into politics
or statistics: let me, therefore, escape from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We reached Verona the second day: it is delightfully situated.
Mr. Addison has given a very beautiful description of the Giusti
gardens which overlook it on one side. They here shew you the
tomb of Juliet: it looks like an empty cistern in a common court-yard:
you look round, however, and the carved niches with the
frescoes on the walls convince you that you are in the precincts of
an ancient monastery. The guide also points to the part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>wall that Romeo leaped over, and takes you to the spot in the
garden where he fell. This gives an air of trick and fiction to the
whole. The tradition is a thousand years old: it is kept up with
a tender and pious awe: the interest taken in the story of a passion
faithful to death shews not that the feeling is<a id='t277'></a> rare, but common.
Many Italian women have read Shakspeare’s tragedy of Romeo and
Juliet, admire and criticise it with great feeling. What remains of
the old monastery is at present a Foundling Hospital. On returning
from this spot, which is rather low and gloomy, we witnessed the
most brilliant sight we had seen in Italy—the sun setting in a flood
of gold behind the Alps that overlook the lake of Garda. The
Adige foamed at our feet below; the bank opposite was of pure
emerald; the hills which rose directly behind it in the most
fantastic forms were of perfect purple, and the arches of the bridge
to the left seemed plunged in ebon darkness by the flames of light
that darted round them. Verona has a less dilapidated, pensive air
than Ferrara. Its streets and squares are airy and spacious; but
the buildings have a more modern and embellished look, and there
is an appearance of greater gaiety and fashion among the inhabitants.
The English sometimes come here to reside, though not in such
crowds as at Florence, and things are proportionably less dear.
The Amphitheatre is nearly as fine and quite as entire as that at
Rome: the Gate of Galienas terminates one of the principal streets.
We met with nothing remarkable the rest of the way to Milan,
except the same rich, unvaried face of the country; the distant Alps
hanging like a thin film over the horizon, or approaching nearer in
lofty, solid masses as we advanced; the lake of Garda embosomed in
them, and the fine fortress of Peschiera buried in its almost
subterranean fastnesses like a mole; the romantic town of Virli, with
a rainbow glittering over its verdant groves and hills; a very bad inn
at Brescia, and a very excellent one at Treviglio. Milan was alive
and full of visitors, thick as the ‘motes that people the sun-beam;’
it felt the presence of its lord. The Emperor of Austria was there!
Milan (at least on this occasion) was as gay as Bath or any town in
England. How times and the characters of countries change with
them! In other parts of Italy, as at Rome and at Florence, the
business of the inhabitants seemed to be to hide themselves, neither
to see nor be seen: here it was evidently their object to do both.
The streets were thronged and in motion, and the promenades full
of carriages and of elegantly-dressed women, as on a festival or gala-day.
I think I never saw so many well-grown, well-made, good-looking
women as at Milan. I did not however see one face
strikingly beautiful, or with a very fine expression. In this respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the Romans have the advantage of them. The North has a tinge
of robust barbarism in it. Their animation was a little exuberant;
their look almost amounts to a stare, their walk is a swing, their
curiosity is not free from an air of defiance. The free and
unrestrained manners of former periods of Italy appear also to have
been driven northward, and to have lingered longer on the confines.
The Cathedral or Duomo is a splendid fabric of white marble: it is
rich, vast, and the inside solemn and full of a religious awe: the
marble is from a quarry on the Lago Maggiore. We also saw the
celebrated theatre of the Gran Scala, which is of an immense size
and of extreme beauty, but it was not full, nor was the performance
striking. The manager is the proprietor of the Cobourg Theatre
(Mr. Glossop), and his wife (formerly our Miss Fearon) the
favourite singer of the Milanese circles. I inquired after the great
pantomime Actress, Pallarini, but found she had retired from the
stage on a fortune. The name of Vigano was not known to my
informant. I did not see the great picture of the Last Supper by
Leonardo nor the little Luini, two miles out of Milan, which my
friend Mr. Beyle charged me particularly to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left Milan, in a calash or small open carriage, to proceed to
the Isles Borromees. The first day it rained violently, and the
third day the boy drove us wrong, pretending to mistake Laveno for
Baveno; so I got rid of him. We had a delightful morning at
Como, and a fine view of the lake and surrounding hills, which
however rise too precipitously from the shores to be a dwelling-place
for any but hunters and fishermen. Several English gentlemen as well
as rich Milanese have villas on the banks. I had a hankering after
Cadenobia; but the Simplon still lay before me. We were utterly
disappointed in the Isles Borromees. Isola Bella, belonging to the
Marquis Borromeo, indeed resembles ‘a pyramid of sweetmeats
ornamented with green festoons and flowers.’ I had supposed this
to be a heavy German conceit, but it is a literal description. The
pictures in the Palace are trash. We were accosted by a beggar in
an island which contains only a palace and an inn. We proceeded
to the inn at Baveno, situated on the high road, close to the lake,
and enjoyed for some days the enchanting and varied scenery along
its banks. The abrupt rocky precipices that overhang it—the woods
that wave in its refreshing breeze—the distant hills—the gliding
sails and level shore at the opposite extremity—the jagged summits
of the mountains that look down upon Palanza and Feriole, and
the deep defiles and snowy passes of the Simplon, every kind of
sublimity or beauty, changing every moment with the shifting light
or point of view from which you beheld them. We were tempted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>stop here for the summer in a suite of apartments (not ill furnished)
that command a panoramic view of the lake hidden by woods and
vineyards from all curious eyes, or in a similar set of rooms at Intra
on the other side of the lake, with a garden and the conveniences of
a market-town, for six guineas for the half year. Hear this, ye who
pine in England on limited incomes, and with a taste for the
picturesque! The temptation was great, and may yet prove too
strong. We wished, however, to pass the Simplon first. We
proceeded to Domo d’ Ossola for this purpose, and the next day
began the ascent. I have already attempted to describe the passage
of Mont Cenis: this is said to be finer, and I believe it; but it
impressed me less, I believe owing to circumstances. The road
does not wind its inconceivable breathless way down the side of the
same mountain (like the circumgyrations of an eagle), gallery seeing
gallery sunk beneath it, but makes longer reaches, and passes over
from one side of the valley to the other. The ascent is nearly by
the side of the brook of the Simplon for several miles, and you pass
along by the edge of precipices and by slender bridges over
mountain-torrents, under huge brown rugged rocks, hanging over the
road like mighty masses of ruins or castle walls—some bare, others
covered with pine-trees to the top; some too steep for any plant to
grow on them, others displaying spots of verdure, the thatched
cottage, and the winding path half-way up, and dallying with vernal
flowers and the winter’s snow to the last moment. The fir generally
clothes them, and its spiny form and dark hues combine well with
their ‘star-ypointing pyramids,’ and ashy paleness. The eagle
screams over-head, and the chamois looks startled round. Half-way
up a little rugged path (the pathway of their life) loitered a young
peasant and his mistress hand in hand, with some older people
behind, following to their peaceful humble home—half hid among
the cliffs and clouds. We passed under one or two sounding arches,
and over some lofty bridges. At length we reached the village of
the Simplon, and stopped there at a most excellent inn, where we
had a supper that might vie, for taste and elegance, with that with
which Chiffinch entertained Peveril of the Peak and his companion
at the little inn, in the wilds of Derbyshire. The next day we
proceeded onwards, and passed the commencement of the tremendous
glacier of the Flech Horr. Monteroso ascended to the right,
shrouded in cloud and mist, at a height inaccessible even to the eye.
This mountain is only a few hundred feet lower than Mont-Blanc,
yet its name is hardly known. So a difference of a hair’s breadth
in talent often makes all the difference between total obscurity and
endless renown! We soon after passed the barrier, and found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>ourselves involved in fog and driving sleet upon the brink of
precipices: the view was hidden, the road dangerous. On our right
were drifts of snow left there by the avalanches. Soon after the
mist dispersed, or we had perhaps passed below it, and a fine sunny
morning disclosed the whole amazing scene above, about, below us.
On our right was the Swartzenberg, behind us the Simplon, on our
left the Flech Horr, and the pointed Clise-Horn—opposite was the
Yung-Frow, and the distant mountains of the lake of Geneva rose
between, circled with wreaths of mist and sunshine: stately fir-trees
measured the abrupt descent at our side, or the sound of dimly-seen
cataracts; and in an opening below, seen through the steep chasm
under our feet, lay the village of Brigg (as in a map) still half a
day’s journey distant. We wound round the valley at the other
extremity of it: the road on the opposite side, which we could
plainly distinguish, seemed almost on the level ground, and when we
reached it we found a still greater depth below us. Villages, cottages,
flocks of sheep in the valley underneath, now came in sight, and
made the eye giddy to look at them: huge cedars by the road-side
were interposed between us and the rocks and mountains opposite,
and threw them into half-tint; and the height above our heads, and
that beneath our feet, by being perceptibly joined together, doubled
the elevation of the objects. Mountains seem highest either when
you are at their very summits and look down on the world, or when
you are midway up, and the eye takes in the measure of their height
at two distinct stages. I think the finest part of the descent of the
Simplon is about four or five miles before you come to Brigg. The
valley is here narrow, and affords prodigious contrasts of wood and
rock, of hill and vale, of sheltered beauty and of savage grandeur.
The red perpendicular chasm in the rock at the foot of the Clise-Horn
is tremendous; the look back to the snow-clad Swartzenberg
that you have left behind is no less so. I grant the Simplon has the
advantage of Mont Cenis in variety and beauty and in sudden and
terrific contrasts, but it has not the same simple expansive grandeur,
blending and growing into one vast accumulated impression; nor is
the descent of the same whirling and giddy character, as if you were
hurried, stage after stage, and from one yawning depth to another,
into the regions of ‘Chaos and old Night.’ The Simplon presents
more picturesque points of view; Mont Cenis makes a stronger
impression on the imagination. I am not prejudiced in favour of one
or the other; the road over each was raised by the same master-hand.
After a jaunt like this through the air, it was requisite to
pause some time at the hospitable inn at Brigg to recover. It only
remains for me to describe the lake of Geneva and Mont Blanc.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We left the inn at Brigg, after having stopped there above a week,
and proceeded on our way to Vevey, which had always been an
interesting point in the horizon, and a resting-place to the imagination.
In travelling, we visit <em>names</em> as well as places; and Vevey is
the scene of the <em>New Eloise</em>. In spite of Mr. Burke’s philippic
against this performance, the contempt of the <em>Lake School</em>, and Mr.
Moore’s late <cite>Rhymes on the Road</cite>, I had still some overmastering
recollections on that subject, which I proposed to indulge at my
leisure on the spot which was supposed to give them birth, and which
I accordingly did. I did not, on a re-perusal, find my once favourite
work quite so vapid, quite so void of eloquence or sentiment as some
critics (it is true, not much beholden to it) would insinuate. The
following passage, among others, seemed to me the perfection of
style:—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais vois la rapidité de cet astre, qui vole et ne s’arrête
jamais; le tems fuit, l’occasion échappe, ta beauté, ta beauté même aura
son terme, elle doit flétrir et périr un jour comme un fleur qui tombe sans
avoir été cueilli!</span></i>’ What a difference between the sound of this
passage and of Mr. Moore’s verse or prose! Nay, there is more
imagination in the single epithet <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">astre</span></i>, applied as it is here to this
brilliant and fleeting scene of things, than in all our fashionable poet’s
writings! At least I thought so, reading St. Preux’s Letter in the
wood near Clarens, and stealing occasional glances at the lake and
rocks of Meillerie. But I am anticipating.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mountains on either side of the Valley of the Simplon present
a gloomy succession of cliffs, often covered with snow, and contrasting
by no means agreeably with the marshy grounds below, through which
the Rhone wanders scarce noticed, scarce credited. It is of a whitish
muddy colour (from the snow and sand mingled with its course, very
much as if had been poured out of a washing-tub), and very different
from the deep purple tint it assumes on oozing out from the other
side of the Lake, after having drank its cerulean waters. The
woods near the lofty peaks of the Clise-Horn, and bordering on
Monteroso, are said to be still the frequent haunt of bears, though a
price is set upon their heads. As we advanced farther on beyond
Tortomania, the whole breadth of the valley was sometimes covered
with pine-forests, which gave a relief to the eye, and afforded scope
to the imagination. The fault of mountain scenery in general is,
that it is too barren and naked, and that the whole is exposed in
enormous and unvarying masses to the view at once. The clothing
of trees is no less wanted as an ornament than partially to conceal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>objects, and thus present occasional new points of view. Without
something to intercept and break the aggregate extent of surface, you
gain no advantage by change of place; the same elevation and ground-plan
of hill and valley are still before you—you might as well carry a
map or landscape in your hand. In this part of our journey, however,
besides the natural wildness and grandeur of the scenery, the road
was rough and uneven, and frequently crossed rude bridges over the
Rhone, or over rivulets pouring into it: the gloomy recesses of the
forests might be the abode of wild beasts or of the lurking robber.
The huge fragments of rock that had tumbled from the overhanging
precipices often made a turning in the road necessary, and for a
moment interrupted the view beyond; the towns, built on the sides
of the hills, resembled shattered heaps of rock, scarcely distinguishable
from the grey peaks and crags with which they were surrounded,
giving an agreeable play to the fancy; while the snowy tops of the
Simplon mountains, now coming in sight, now hidden behind the
nearer summits, threw us back to the scenes we had left, and measured
the distance we had traversed. The way in which these mighty
landmarks of the Alpine regions ascertain this point is, however,
contrary to the usual one: for it is by appearing plainer, the farther
you retire from them. They tower with airy shape and dazzling
whiteness above the lengthening perspective; and it is the intervening
objects that dwindle in the comparison, and are lost sight of in
succession. In the midst of the most lonely and singular part of this
scene, just as we passed a loose bridge of rough fir-planks over a
brawling brook, and as a storm seemed to threaten us, we met a party
of English gentlemen in an open carriage, though their courteous
looks and waving salutation almost ‘forbade us to interpret them
such.’ Certainly there is no people in whom urbanity is more a
duty than the English; for there is no people that feel it more.
Travelling confounds our ideas, not of place only, but of time; and I
could not help making a sudden transition from the party we had by
chance encountered to the Chevalier Grandison and his friends,
paying their last visit to Bologna. Pshaw! Why do I indulge in
such idle fancies? Yet why in truth should I not, when I am a
thousand miles from home, and when every object one meets is like
a dream? <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Passe pour cela.</span></i></p>

<p class='c000'>We reached Sion that evening. It is one of the dirtiest and least
comfortable towns on the road; nor does the chief inn deserve the
epithet so applicable to Swiss inns in general—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">simplex munditiis</span></i>. It
was here that Rousseau, in one of his early peregrinations, was
recommended by his landlord to an iron-foundry in the neighbourhood
(the smoke of which, I believe, we saw at a little distance), where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>he would be likely to procure employment, mistaking ‘the pauper
lad’ for a journeyman blacksmith. Perhaps the author of the
<cite>Rhymes on the Road</cite> will think it a pity he did not embrace this
proposal, instead of forging thunderbolts for kingly crowns. Alas!
Mr. Moore would then never have had to write his ‘Fables for the
Holy Alliance.’ Haunted by some indistinct recollection of this
adventure, I asked at the Inn, ‘If Jean Jacques Rousseau had ever
resided in the town?’ The waiter himself could not tell, but soon
after brought back for answer, ‘That Monsieur Rousseau had never
lived there, but that he had passed through about fourteen years before
on his way to Italy, when he had only time to stop to take tea!’—Was
this a mere stupid blunder, or one of the refractions of fame,
founded on his mission as Secretary to the Venetian Ambassador a
hundred years before? There is a tradition in the neighbourhood of
Milton’s house in York-street, Westminster, that ‘one Mr. <em>Milford</em>,
a celebrated poet, formerly lived there!’ We set forward the next
morning on our way to Martigny, through the most dreary valley
possible, and in an absolute straight line for twelve or fifteen miles of
level road, which was terminated by the village-spire and by the hills
leading to the Great St. Bernard and Mont-Blanc. The wind
poured down from these tremendous hills, and blew with unabated
fury in our faces the whole way. It was a most unpleasant ride, nor
did the accommodations at the inn (the Swan, I think) make us
amends. The rooms were cold and empty. It might be supposed
that the desolation without had subdued the imagination to its own
hue and quality, so that it rejected all attempts at improvement; that
the more niggard Nature had been to it, the more churlish it became
to itself; and through habit, neither felt the want of comforts nor a
wish to supply others with them. Close to the bridge stands a steep
rock with a castle at the top of it (attributed to the times of the
Romans). At a distance it was hardly discernible; and afterwards,
when we crossed over to Chamouni, we saw it miles below us like a
dove-cot, or a dirt-pye raised by children. Yet viewed from beneath,
it seemed to present an imposing and formidable attitude, and to
elevate its pigmy front in a line with the stately heights around. So
Mr. Washington Irvine binds up his own portrait with Goldsmith’s in
the Paris edition of his works, and to many people seems the <em>genteeler</em>
man! From the definite and dwarfish, we turned to the snow-clad
and cloud-capt; and strolled to the other side of the village, where the
road parts to St. Bernard and Chamouni, anxiously gazing at the steep
pathway on either side, and half tempted to launch into that billowy
sea of mist and mountain: but we reserved this for a subsequent
period. As we were loitering at the foot of the dizzy ascent, our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>postilion, who had staid behind us a couple of hours the day before to
play at bowls, now drove on half an hour before his time, and when
we turned a corner which gave us a view of our inn, no cabriolet was
there. He, however, soon found his mistake, and turned back to
meet us. The only picturesque objects between this and Bex are a
waterfall about two hundred feet in height, issuing through the
cavities of the mountain from the immense glacier in the valley of
Trie, and the romantic bridge of St. Maurice, the boundary between
Savoy and the Pays de Vaud. On the ledge of a rocky precipice, as
you approach St. Maurice, stands a hermitage in full view of the
road; and possibly the inmate consoles himself in his voluntary retreat
by watching the carriages as they come in sight, and fancying that the
driver is pointing out his aërial dwelling to the inquisitive and
wondering traveller! If a man could transport himself to one of the
fixed stars, so far from being lifted above this sublunary sphere, he
would still wish his fellow-mortals to point to it as his particular
abode, and the scene of his marvellous adventures. We go into a
crowd to be seen: we go into solitude that we may be distinguished
from the crowd, and talked of. We travel into foreign parts to get
the start of those who stay behind us; we return home to hear what
has been said of us in our absence. Lord Byron mounted on his
pedestal of pride on the shores of the Adriatic, as Mr. Hobhouse
rides in the car of popularity through the streets of Westminster.
The one object could be seen at a distance; the other, whose mind is
more Sancho-Panza-ish and <em>pug-featured</em>, requires to be brought
nearer to the eye for stage-effect! Bex itself is delicious. It stands
in a little nook of quiet, almost out of the world, nestling in rural
beauty, in mountain sublimity. There is an excellent inn, a country
church before it, a large ash tree, a circulating library, a rookery,
every thing useful and comfortable for the life of man. Behind, there
is a ridge of dark rocks; beyond them tall and bare mountains—and
a higher range still appears through rolling clouds and circling mists.
Our reception at the inn was every way what we could wish, and we
were half disposed to stop here for some months. But something
whispered me on to Vevey:—this we reached the next day in a
drizzling shower of rain, which prevented our seeing much of the
country, excepting the black masses of rock and pine-trees that rose
perpendicularly from the roadside. The day after my arrival, I found
a lodging at a farm-house, a mile out of Vevey, so ‘lapped in luxury,’
so retired, so reasonable, and in every respect convenient, that we
remained here for the rest of the summer, and felt no small regret at
leaving it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country round Vevey is, I must nevertheless own, the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>picturesque part of the borders of the Lake of Geneva. I wonder
Rousseau, who was a good judge and an admirable describer of
romantic situations, should have fixed upon it as the scene of the
‘New Eloise.’ You have passed the rocky and precipitous defiles at
the entrance into the valley, and have not yet come into the open and
more agreeable parts of it. The immediate vicinity of Vevey is
entirely occupied with vineyards slanting to the south, and inclosed
between stone-walls without any kind of variety or relief. The walks
are uneven and bad, and you in general see little (for the walls on
each side of you) but the glassy surface of the Lake, the rocky
barrier of the Savoy Alps opposite (one of them crowned all the year
round with snow, and which, though it is twenty miles off, seems as
if you could touch it with your hand, so completely does size neutralize
the effect of distance), the green hills of an inferior class over Clarens,
with the Dent de Jamant sticking out of them like an iron tooth, and
the winding valley leading northward towards Berne and Fribourg.
Here stands Gelamont (the name of the <em>Campagna</em> which we took),
on a bank sloping down to the brook that passes by Vevey, and so
entirely embosomed in trees and ‘upland swells,’ that it might be
called, in poetical phrase, ‘the peasant’s nest.’ Here every thing
was perfectly clean and commodious. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fermier</span></i> or vineyard-keeper,
with his family, lived below, and we had six or seven rooms
on a floor (furnished with every article or convenience that a London
lodging affords) for thirty Napoleons for four months, or about
thirty shillings a week. This first expense we found the greatest
during our stay, and nearly equal to all the rest, that of a servant
included. The number of English settled here had made lodgings
dear, and an English gentleman told me he was acquainted with not
less than three-and-twenty English families in the neighbourhood.
To give those who may feel an inclination to try foreign air, an idea
of the comparative cheapness of living abroad, I will mention that
mutton (equal to the best Welch mutton, and fed on the high grounds
near Moudon) is two batz, that is, threepence English per pound;
and the beef (which is also good, though not of so fine a quality) is
the same. Trout, caught in the Lake, you get almost for nothing.
A couple of fowls is eighteen-pence. The wine of the country,
which though not rich, is exceedingly palatable, is three pence a
bottle. You may have a basket of grapes in the season for one
shilling or fifteen pence.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> The bread, butter and milk are equally
cheap and excellent. They have not the art here of adulterating
every thing. You find the same things as in England, served up in
the same plain and decent manner, but in greater plenty, and generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>speaking, of a better and more wholesome quality, and at least twice
as cheap. In England they have few things, and they contrive to
spoil those few. There is a good deal of ill-nature and churlishness,
as well as a narrow policy in this. The trading principle seems to be
to give you the worst, and make you pay as dear for it as possible.
It is a vile principle. As soon as you land at Dover, you feel the
force of this <em>home</em> truth. They cheat you to your face, and laugh at
you. I must say, that it appears to me, whatever may be the faults
or vices of other nations, the English <em>population</em> is the only one to
which the epithet <em>blackguard</em> is applicable. They are, in a word, the
only people who make a merit of giving others pain, and triumph in
their impudence and ill-behaviour, as proofs of a manly and independent
spirit. Afraid that you may complain of the absence of foreign
luxuries, they are determined to let you understand beforehand, they
do not care about what you may think, and wanting the art to please,
resort to the easier and surer way of keeping up their importance by
practising every kind of annoyance. Instead of their being at your
mercy, you find yourself at theirs, subjected to the sullen airs of the
masters, and to the impertinent fatuity of the waiters. They dissipate
your theory of English comfort and hospitality at the threshold.
What do they care that you have cherished a fond hope of getting a
nice, <em>snug</em> little dinner on your arrival, better than any you have had
in France? ‘The French may be d——,’ is the answer that passes
through their minds—‘the dinner is good enough, if it is English!’
Let us take care, that by assuming an insolent local superiority over
all the world, we do not sink below them in every thing, liberty not
excepted. While the name of any thing passes current, we may
dispense with the reality, and keep the start of the rest of mankind,
simply by asserting that we have it, and treating all foreigners as a set
of poor wretches, who neither know how, nor are in truth fit to live!
Against this post, alas! John Bull is continually running his head,
but as yet without knocking his brains out. The beef-steak which
you order at Dover with patriotic tender yearnings for its reputation,
is accordingly filled with cinders—the mutton is done to a rag—the
soup not eatable—the porter sour—the bread gritty—the butter rancid.
Game, poultry, grapes, wine it is in vain to think of; and as you may
be mortified at the privation, they punish you for your unreasonable
dissatisfaction by giving you cause for it in the mismanagement of
what remains.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> In the midst of this ill fare you meet with equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>bad treatment. While you are trying to digest a tough beef-steak, a
fellow comes in and peremptorily demands your fare, on the assurance
that you will get your baggage from the clutches of the Custom-house
in time to go by the six o’clock coach; and when you find that this
is impossible, and that you are to be trundled off at two in the
morning, or by the next day’s coach, <em>if</em> it is not <em>full</em>, and complain to
that personification of blind justice, an English mob, you hear the arch
<em>slang</em> reply, ‘Do you think the Gentleman such a fool as to part with
his money without knowing why?’ and should the natural rejoinder
rise to your lips—‘Do you take me for a fool, because I did not take
you for a rogue?’ the defendant immediately stands at bay upon the
national character for honesty and morality. ‘I hope there are no
rogues here!’ is echoed through the dense atmosphere of English
intellect, though but the moment before they had been laughing in
their sleeves (or out loud) at the idea of a stranger having been
tricked by a townsman. Happy country! equally and stupidly
satisfied with its vulgar vices and boasted virtues!</p>

<p class='c000'>I found little of this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tracasserie</span></i> at Gelamont. Days, weeks, months,
and even years might have passed on much in the same manner, with
‘but the season’s difference.’ We breakfasted at the same hour, and
the tea-kettle was always boiling (an excellent thing in housewifery)—a
<em>lounge</em> in the orchard for an hour or two, and twice a week we
could see the steam-boat creeping like a spider over the surface of the
lake; a volume of the Scotch novels (to be had in every library on
the Continent, in English, French, German, or Italian, as the reader
pleases), or M. Galignani’s Paris and London <cite>Observer</cite>, amused us
till dinner time; then tea and a walk till the moon unveiled itself,
‘apparent queen of night,’ or the brook, swoln with a transient shower,
was heard more distinctly in the darkness, mingling with the soft,
rustling breeze; and the next morning the song of peasants broke
upon refreshing sleep, as the sun glanced among the clustering vine-leaves,
or the shadowy hills, as the mists retired from their summits,
looked in at our windows. The uniformity of this mode of life was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>only broken during fifteen weeks that we remained in Switzerland, by
the civilities of Monsieur Le Vade, a Doctor of medicine and
octogenarian, who had been personally acquainted with Rousseau in
his younger days; by some attempts by our neighbours to <em>lay us under
obligations</em>, by parting with rare curiosities to Monsieur l’Anglois for
half their value; and by an excursion to Chamouni, of which I must
defer the account to my next.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p class='c008'>We crossed over in a boat to St. Gingolph, a little town opposite to
Vevey, and proceeded on the other side of the lake to Martigny,
from which we could pass over either on foot or by the help of mules
to Mont-Blanc. It was a warm day towards the latter end of
August, and the hills before us drew their clear outline, and the more
distant Alps waved their snowy tops (tinged with golden sunshine) in
the gently-undulating surface of the crystal lake. As we approached
the Savoy side, the mountains in front, which from Vevey look like
a huge battery or flat upright wall, opened into woody recesses, or
reared their crests on high; rich streaks of the most exquisite verdure
gleamed at their feet, and St. Gingolph came distinctly in view, with
its dingy-looking houses and smoking chimneys. It is a small
manufacturing town, full of forges and workshops, and the inn is dirty
and disagreeable. The contrast to Vevey was striking. But this
side of the lake is in the dominions of the King of Sardinia, and
cleanliness seems to be in general the virtue of republics, or of free
states. There is an air of desolation, sluttishness, and indifference,
the instant you cross the water, compared with the neatness, activity,
regularity, and cheerfulness of the Pays de Vaud. We walked out to
take a view of the situation, as soon as we had bespoken our room and
a supper. It was a brilliant sunset; nor do I recollect having ever
beheld so majestic and rich a scene, set off to such advantage. A
steep pathway led to a village embayed between two mountains, whose
tops towered into the sky: conical hills rose to about half their
height, covered with green copses: fields and cottages were seen
climbing as it were the sides of others, with cattle feeding; the huge
projecting rocks gave new combinations and a new aspect to the most
picturesque objects; tall branching trees (ash, or beech, or chesnut)
hung from green sloping banks over the road-side, or dipped their
foliage in the transparent wave below: their bold luxuriant forms
threw the rocks and mountains into finer relief, and elevated them
into a higher atmosphere, so that they seemed trembling (another airy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>world) over our heads. The lake shone like a broad golden mirror,
reflecting the thousand dyes of the fleecy purple clouds, while Saint
Gingolph, with its clustering habitations, shewed like a dark pitchy
spot by its side; and beyond the glimmering verge of the Jura (almost
hid in its own brightness) hovered gay wreaths of clouds, fair, lovely,
visionary, that seemed not of this world, but brought from some dream
of fancy, treasured up from past years, emblems of hope, of joy and
smiling regret, that had come to grace a scene so heavenly, and to bid
it a last, lingering farewell. No person can describe the effect; but
so in Claude’s landscapes the evening clouds drink up the rosy light,
and sink into soft repose! Every one who travels into Switzerland
should visit this secluded spot, and witness such a sunset, with the
heaven stooping its face into the lake on one side, and the mountains,
rocks, and woods, lifting earth to heaven on the other. We had no
power to leave it or to admire it, till the evening shades stole in upon
us, and drew the dusky veil of twilight over it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had a pleasant walk the next morning along the side of the
lake under the grey cliffs, the green hills and azure sky; now passing
under the open gateway of some dilapidated watch-tower that had in
former times connected the rocky barrier with the water, now watching
the sails of a boat slowly making its way among the trees on the
banks of the Rhone, like butterflies expanding their wings in the
breeze, or the snowy ridges that seemed close to us at Vevey receding
farther into a kind of lofty back-ground as we advanced. The
speculation of Bishop Berkeley, or some other philosopher, that
distance is measured by motion and not by the sight, is verified here
at every step. After going on for hours, and perceiving no alteration
in the form or appearance of the object before you, you begin
to be convinced that it is out of ordinary calculation, or, in the
language of the <em>Fancy</em>, an ‘ugly customer;’ and our curiosity once
excited, is ready to magnify every circumstance relating to it
to an indefinite extent. The literal impression being discarded as
insufficient, the imagination takes out an unlimited letter of credit
for all that is possible or wonderful, and what the eye sees is considered
thenceforward merely as an imperfect hint, to be amplified
and filled up on a colossal scale by the understanding and rules of
proportion. To say the truth, you also suffer a change, feel like
Lilliputians, and can fancy yourselves transported to a different
world, where the dimensions and relations of things are regulated
by some unknown law. The inn where we stopped at Vionnax is
bad. Beyond this place, the hills at the eastern end of the lake
form into an irregular and stupendous amphitheatre; and you pass
through long and apparently endless vistas of tall flourishing trees,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>without being conscious of making much progress. There is a
glass-manufactory at Vionnax, which I did not go to see; others
who have more curiosity may. It will be there (I dare say) next
year for those who choose to visit it: I liked neither its glare nor
its heat. The cold icy crags that hang suspended over it have been
there a thousand years, and will be there a thousand years to come.
Short-lived as we are, let us attach ourselves to the immortal, and
scale (assisted by earth’s giant brood) the empyrean of pure thought!
But the English abroad turn out of their way to see every pettifogging,
huckstering object that they could see better at home, and
are as <em>fussy</em> and fidgetty, with their smoke-jacks and mechanical
inventions among the Alps, as if they had brought Manchester and
Sheffield in their pockets! The finest effect along this road is the
view of the bridge as you come near St. Maurice. The mountains
on either side here descend nearly to a point, boldly and abruptly;
the river flows rapidly through the tall arch of the bridge, on one
side of which you see an old fantastic turret, and beyond it the hill
called the Sugar-loaf, rising up in the centre of immense ranges of
mountains, and with fertile and variously-marked plains stretching
out in the intervening space. The landscape painter has only to go
there, and make a picture of it. It is already framed by nature to
his hand! I mention this the more, because that kind of <em>grouping</em> of
objects which is essential to the picturesque, is not always to be found
in the most sublime or even beautiful scenes. Nature (so to speak)
uses a larger canvass than man, and where she is greatest and most
prodigal of her wealth, often neglects that principle of concentration
and contrast which is an indispensable preliminary before she can be
translated with effect into the circumscribed language of art. We
supped at Martigny, at the Hotel de la Poste (formerly a convent),
and the next morning proceeded by the Valley of Trie and the Col
de Peaume to Chamouni.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left the great St. Bernard, and the road by which Buonaparte
passed to Marengo, on our left, and Martigny and the Valley of the
Simplon directly behind us. These last were also soon at an immeasurable
depth below us; but the summits of the mountains that
environed us on all sides, seemed to ascend with us, and to add our
elevation to their own. Crags, of which we could only before
discern the jutting tops, gradually reared their full stature at our
side; and icy masses, one by one, came in sight, emerging from their
lofty recesses, like clouds floating in mid-air. All this while a green
valley kept us company by the road-side, watered with gushing rills,
interspersed with cottages and well-stocked farms: fine elms and ash
grew on the sides of the hills, under the shade of one of which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>saw an old peasant asleep. The road, however, was long, rough,
and steep; and from the heat of the sun, and the continual interruption
of loose stones and the straggling roots of trees, I felt myself
exceedingly exhausted. We had a mule, a driver, and a guide. I
was advised, by all means, to lessen the fatigue of the ascent by
taking hold of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">queue of Monsieur le Mulet</span></i>, a mode of travelling
partaking as little of the sublime as possible, and to which I reluctantly
acceded. We at last reached the top, and looked down on the
Valley of Trie, bedded in rocks, with a few wooden huts in it, a
mountain-stream traversing it from the <em>Glacier</em> at one end, and with
an appearance as if summer could never gain a footing there, before
it would be driven out by winter. In the midst of this almost
inaccessible and desolate spot, we found a little inn or booth, with
refreshments of wine, bread, and fruit, and a whole drove of English
travellers, mounted or on foot.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Nor Alps nor Apennines can keep them out,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor fortified redoubt!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we mounted the steep wood on the other side of the valley, we
met several mules returning, with their drivers only, and looking
extremely picturesque, as they were perched above our heads among
the jagged pine-trees, and cautiously felt their perilous way over the
edges of projecting rocks and stumps of trees, down the zigzag
pathway. The view here is precipitous, extensive, and truly appalling,
both from the size of the objects and their rugged wildness. The
smell of the pine-trees, the clear air, and the golden sunshine gleaming
through the dark foliage refreshed me; and the fatigue from which
I had suffered in the morning completely wore off. I had concluded
that when we got to the top of the wood that hung over our heads,
we should have mastered our difficulties; but they only then began.
We emerged into a barren heath or morass of a most toilsome ascent,
lengthening as we advanced, with herds of swine, sheep, and cattle
feeding on it, and a bed of half-melted snow marking the summit
over which we had to pass. We turned aside, half-way up this
dreary wilderness, to stop at a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chalet</span></i>, where a boy, who tended the
straggling cattle, was fast asleep in the middle of the day; and being
waked up, procured us a draught of most delicious water from a
fountain. We at length reached the Col de Peaume, and saw Mont
Blanc, the King of Mountains, stretching away to the left, with
clouds circling round its sides, and snows forever resting on its head.
It was an image of immensity and eternity. Earth had heaved it
from its bosom; the ‘vast cerulean’ had touched it with its breath.
It was a meeting of earth and sky. Other peaked cliffs rose perpendicularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>by its side, and a range of rocks, of red granite, fronted
it to the north; but Mont-Blanc itself was round, bald, shining,
ample, and equal in its swelling proportions—a huge dumb heap
of matter. The valley below was bare, without an object—no
ornament, no contrast to set it off—it reposed in silence and in
solitude, a world within itself.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Retire, the world shut out, thy thoughts call home.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is an end here of vanity and littleness, and all transitory jarring
interests. You stand, as it were, in the presence of the Spirit of the
Universe, before the majesty of Nature, with her chief elements about
you; cloud and air, and rock, and stream, and mountain are brought
into immediate contact with primeval Chaos and the great First
Cause. The mind hovers over mysteries deeper than the abysses
at our feet; its speculations soar to a height beyond the visible forms
it sees around it. As we descended the path on foot (for our
muleteer was obliged to return at the barrier between the two states
of Savoy and Switzerland marked by a solitary unhewn stone,) we
saw before us the shingled roofs of a hamlet, situated on a patch of
verdure near inaccessible columns of granite, and could hear the
tinkling bells of a number of cattle pasturing below (an image of
patriarchal times!)—we also met one or two peasants returning home
with loads of fern, and still farther down, found the ripe harvests
of wheat and barley growing close up to the feet of the glaciers
(those huge masses of ice arrested in their passage from the mountains,
and collected by a thousand winters,) and the violet and gilliflower
nestling in the cliffs of the hardest rocks. There are four of these
glaciers, that pour their solid floods into the valley, with rivulets
issuing from them into the Arbe. The one next to Chamouni is,
I think, the finest. It faces you like a broad sheet of congealed
snow and water about half-way up the lofty precipice, and then
spreads out its arms on each side into seeming batteries and fortifications
of undistinguishable rock and ice, as though winter had here
‘built a fortress for itself,’ seated in stern state, and amidst frowning
horrors. As we advanced into the plain, and before it became dusk,
we could discern at a distance the dark wood that skirts the glaciers
of Mont-Blanc, the spire of Chamouni, and the bridges that cross the
stream. We also discovered, a little way on before us, stragglers on
mules, and a cabriolet, that was returning from the valley of Trie,
by taking a more circuitous route. As the day closed in and was
followed by the moonlight, the mountains on our right hung over us
like a dark pall, and the glaciers gleamed like gigantic shrouds
opposite. We might have fancied ourselves inclosed in a vast tomb,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>but for the sounding cataracts and the light clouds that flitted over
our heads. We arrived at Chamouni at last, and found the three
inns crowded with English. The entrance to that to which we had
been recommended, or rather were conducted by our guide (the
Hotel de Londres,) was besieged by English loungers, like a bazaar,
or an hotel at some fashionable watering-place, and we were glad to
secure a small but comfortable room for the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had an excellent supper, the materials of which we understood
came from Geneva. We proceeded the next morning to Saleges, on
our way to this capital. If the entrance to the valley of Chamouni
is grand and simple, the route from it towards Geneva unites the
picturesque to the sublime in the most remarkable degree. For two
or three miles you pass along under Mont-Blanc, looking up at it with
awe and wonder, derived from a knowledge of its height. The
interest, the pleasure you take in it is from conviction and reflection;
but turn a corner in the road at a homely village and a little bridge,
and it shoots up into the sky of its own accord, like a fantastic vision.
Its height is incredible, its brightness dazzling, and you notice the
snow crusted upon its surface into round hillocks, with pellucid
shadows like shining pavilions for the spirits of the upper regions
of the air. Why is the effect so different from its former desolate
and lumpish appearance? Tall rocks rise from the roadside with
dark waving pine-trees shooting from them, over the highest top of
which, as you look up, you see Mont-Blanc; a ruined tower serves
as a foil to the serene smiler in the clouds that mocks at the defences
of art, or the encroachments of time. Another mountain opposite,
part bare, part clothed with wood, intercepts the view to the left,
giving effect to what is seen, and leaving more to the imagination;
and the impetuous torrent roars at your feet, a hundred fathoms
below, with the bright red clusters of the mountain-ash and loose
fragments of rock bending over it, and into which a single step would
precipitate you. One of the mightiest objects in nature is set off by
the most appropriate and striking accidents; and the impression is of
the most romantic and enchanting kind. The scene has an intoxicating
effect; you are relieved from the toil of wishing to admire, and
the imagination is delighted to follow the lead of the senses. We
passed this part of the road in a bright morning, incessantly turning
back to admire, and finding fresh cause of pleasure and wonder at
every step or pause, loth to leave it, and yet urged onward by
continual displays of new and endless beauties. Chamouni seems to
lie low enough; but we found that the river and the road along with
it winds and tumbles for miles over steep banks or sloping ground;
and as you revert your eye, you find that which was a flat converted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>into a <em>table-land</em>; the objects which were lately beneath you now
raised above you, and forming an intermediate stage between the spot
where you are and the more distant elevations; and the last snow-crowned
summits reflected in translucent pools of water by the roadside,
with spots of the brightest azure in them (denoting mineral
springs); the luxuriant branches of the ash, willow, and acacia
waving over them, and the scarlet flowers of the geranium, or the
water-lilies, ‘all silver white,’ stuck like gems in the girdle of old
winter, and offering a sparkling foreground to the retiring range of
icebergs and <em>avalanches</em>. This rapid and whirling descent continued
almost to Saleges, about twenty miles from Chamouni. Here we
dined, and proceeded that night to Bonneville, on nearly level ground;
but still with the same character the whole way of a road winding
through the most cultivated and smiling country, full of pastures,
orchards, vineyards, cottages, villas, refreshing streams, long avenues
of trees, and every kind of natural and artificial beauty, flanked with
rocks and precipices (on each side) of the most abrupt and terrific
appearance, and on which, from the beginning of time, the hand of
man has made no impression, except that here and there you see
a patch of verdure, a cottage, a flock of sheep, at a height which
the eye can hardly reach, and which you think no foot could tread.
I have seen no country where I have been more tempted to stop
and enjoy myself, where I thought the inhabitants had more
reason to be satisfied, and where, if you could not find happiness, it
seemed in vain to seek farther for it. You have every kind and
degree of enjoyment; the extremes of luxury and wildness, gigantic
sublimity at a distance or over your head, elegance and comfort at
your feet; you may gaze at the air-drawn Alps, or shut out the
prospect by a flowering shrub, or by a well-clipped hedge, or neatly-wainscoted
parlour: and you may vary all these as you please, ‘with
kindliest interchange.’ Perhaps one of these days I may try the
experiment, and turn my back on sea-coal fires, and old English
friends! The inn at Bonneville was dirty, ill-provided, and as it
generally happens in such cases, the people were inattentive, and the
charges high. We were, however, indemnified by the reception we
met with at Geneva, where the living was luxurious, and the expence
comparatively trifling. I shall not dwell on this subject, lest I should
be thought an epicure, though indeed I rather ‘live a man forbid,’
being forced to deny myself almost all those good things which I
recommend to others. Geneva is, I think, a very neat and picturesque
town, not equal to some others we had seen, but very well for a
Calvinistic capital. It stands on a rising ground, at the end of the
lake, with the purple Rhone running by it, and Mont-Blanc and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Savoy Alps seen on one side, and the Jura on the other. I was
struck with the fine forms of many of the women here. Though I
was pleased with my fare, I was not altogether delighted with the
manners and appearance of the inhabitants. Their looks may be said
to be moulded on the republican maxim, that ‘you are no better than
they,’ and on the natural inference from it, that ‘they are better than
you.’ They pass you with that kind of scrutinizing and captious air,
as if some controversy was depending between you as to the form of
religion or government. I here saw Rousseau’s house, and also read
the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for May. The next day we passed along in
the Diligence through scenery of exquisite beauty and perfect cultivation—vineyards
and farms, and villas and hamlets of the most
enviable description, succeeding each other in uninterrupted connexion,
by the smooth margin of the silver lake. We saw Lausanne by
moonlight. Its situation, as far as I could judge, and the environs
were superb. We arrived that night at Vevey, after a week’s absence
and an exceedingly delightful tour.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p class='c008'>We returned down the Rhine through Holland. I was willing to
see the contrast between flat and lofty, and between Venice and
Amsterdam. We left Vevey on the 20th of September, and arrived
in England on the 16th of October. It was at first exceedingly hot;
we encountered several days of severe cold on the road, and it afterwards
became mild and pleasant again. We hired a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">char-aux-bancs</span></i>
from Vevey to Basle, and it took us four days to reach this latter
place; the expense of the conveyance was twenty-four francs a day,
besides the driver. The first part of our journey, as we ascended
from the Lake on the way to Moudon, was like an aërial voyage,
from the elevation and the clearness of the atmosphere; yet still
through the most lovely country imaginable, and with glimpses of the
grand objects behind us (seen over delicious pastures, and through
glittering foliage) that were truly magical. The combinations of
language, however, answer but ill to the varieties of nature, and by
repeating these descriptions so often, I am afraid of becoming tiresome.
My excuse must be, that I have little to relate but what I
saw. After mounting to a considerable height, we descended to
Moudon, a small town situated in a most romantic valley. The
accommodations at the inn here were by no means good, though it is
a place of some pretensions. In proportion to the size of the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and the massiveness of the furniture, the provisions of the kitchen
appeared to be slender, and the attendance slack. The freshness of
the air the next morning, and the striking beauty and rapid changes
of the scenery, soon made us forget any disappointment we had
experienced in this respect. As we ascended a steep hill on this side
of Moudon, and looked back, first at the green dewy valley under
our feet, with the dusky town and the blue smoke rising from it, then
at the road we had traversed the preceding evening, winding among
thick groves of trees, and last at the Savoy Alps on the other side of
the Lake of Geneva (with which we had been familiar for four
months, and which seemed to have no mind to quit us) I perceived a
bright speck close to the top of one of these—I was delighted, and
said it was Mont Blanc. Our driver was of a different opinion, was
positive it was only a cloud, and I accordingly supposed I had taken
a sudden fancy for a reality. I began in secret to take myself to task,
and to lecture myself for my proneness to build theories on the
foundation of my conjectures and wishes. On turning round occasionally,
however, I observed that this cloud remained in the same
place, and I noticed the circumstance to our guide, as favouring my
first suggestion; for clouds do not usually remain long in the same
place. We disputed the point for half a day, and it was not till the
afternoon when we had reached the other side of the lake of
Neufchatel, that this same cloud rising like a canopy over the point
where it had hovered, ‘in shape and station proudly eminent,’ he
acknowledged it to be Mont Blanc. We were then at a distance of
about forty miles from Vevey, and eighty or ninety from Chamouni.
This will give the reader some idea of the scale and nature of this
wonderful scenery. We dined at Iverdun (a pretty town), at the
head of the lake, and passed on to Neufchatel, along its enchanting
and almost unrivalled borders, having the long unaspiring range of the
Jura on our left (from the top of which St. Preux, on his return
from his wanderings round the world, first greeted that country,
where ‘torrents of delight had poured into his heart,’ and, indeed, we
could distinguish the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dent de Jamant</span></i> right over Clarens almost the
whole way), and on our right was the rippling lake, its low cultivated
banks on the other side, then a brown rocky ridge of mountains, and
the calm golden peaks of the snowy passes of the Simplon, the Great
St. Bernard, and (as I was fain to believe) of Monteroso rising into
the evening sky at intervals beyond. Meanwhile we rode on through
a country abounding in farms and vineyards and every kind of comfort,
and deserving the epithets, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verd et riant</span>.’ Sometimes a tall rock
rose by the road side; or a ruinous turret or a well-compacted villa
attracted our attention. Neufchatel is larger and handsomer than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Iverdun, and is remarkable for a number of those genteel and quiet-looking
habitations, where people seem to have retired (in the midst
of society) to spend the rest of their lives in ease and comfort: they
are not for shew, nor are they very striking from situation; they are
neither fashionable nor romantic; but the decency and sober ornaments
of their exterior evidently indicate fireside enjoyments and
cultivated taste within. This kind of retreat, where there is nothing
to surprise, nothing to disgust, nothing to draw the attention out of
itself, uniting the advantages of society and solitude, of simplicity and
elegance, and where the mind can indulge in a sort of habitual and
self-centred satisfaction, is the only one which I should never feel a
wish to quit. The <em>golden mean</em> is, indeed, an exact description of the
mode of life I should like to lead—of the style I should like to write;
but alas! I am afraid I shall never succeed in either object of my
ambition!</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day being cloudy, we lost sight entirely of the highest
range of Alpine hills, and saw them no more afterwards. The road
lay for some miles through an open and somewhat dreary country, in
which the only objects of curiosity were the tall peasant-girls working
in the fields, with their black gauze head-dresses, sticking out from
their matted hair like the wings of a dragon-fly. We, however, had
the Lake of Bienne and Isle of St. Pierre in prospect before us, which
are so admirably described by Rousseau, in his ‘Reveries of a
Solitary Walker,’ and to which he gives the preference over the
Lake of Geneva. The effect from the town of Bienne where we
stopped to dine was not much; but in climbing to the top of a steep
sandy hill beyond it, we saw the whole to great advantage. Evening
was just closing in, and the sky was cloudy, with a few red streaks
near the horizon: the first range of Alps only was discernible; the
Lake was of a dull sombre lead colour, and the Isle of St. Pierre
was like a dark spot in it; the hills on one side of the Lake ascended
abrupt and gloomy; extensive forests swept in magnificent surges over
the rich valley to our left; towns were scattered below us here and
there, as in a map; rocky fragments hung over our heads, with the
shattered trunks of huge pine-trees; a mountain-torrent rushed down
the irregular chasm between us and the base of the mountain, that
rose in misty grandeur on the opposite side; but the whole was in the
greatest keeping, and viewed by the twilight of historic landscape.
Yet amidst all this solemnity and grandeur, the eye constantly reverted
to one little dark speck, the Isle of St. Pierre (where Rousseau had
taken refuge for a few months from his sorrows and his persecutions)
with a more intense interest than all the rest; for the widest prospects
are trivial to the deep recesses of the human heart, and its anxious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>beatings are far more audible than the ‘loud torrent or the whirlwind’s
roar!’ The clouds of vapours, and the ebon cloud of night prevented
our having a distinct view of the road that now wound down
to ——, where we stopped for the night. The inn here (the Rose
and Crown), though almost a solitary house in a solitary valley, is a
very good one, and the cheapest we met with abroad. Our bill for
supper, lodging, and breakfast, amounted to only seven francs. Our
route, the following morning, lay up a broad steep valley, with a fine
gravelly road through it, and forests of pine and other trees, raised
like an amphitheatre on either side. The sun had just risen, and the
drops of rain still hung upon the branches. On the other side we
came into a more open country, and then again were inclosed among
wild and narrow passes of high rock, split either by thunder or
earthquakes into ledges, like castle walls, coming down to the edge of
a stream that winds through the valley, or aspiring to an airy height,
with the diminished pines growing on their very tops, and patches of
verdure and the foliage of other trees flourishing in the interstices
between them. It was the last scene of the kind we encountered. I
begin to tire of these details, and will hasten to the end of my journey,
touching only on a few detached points and places.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Basle.</span>—This is a remarkably neat town; but it lies beyond the
confines of the picturesque. We stopped at the Three Kings, and
were shewn into a long, narrow room, which did not promise well at
first; but the waiter threw up the window at the further end, and we
all at once saw the full breadth of the Rhine, rolling rapidly beneath
it, after passing through the arches of an extensive bridge. It was
clear moonlight, and the effect was fine and unexpected. The broad
mass of water rushed by with clamorous sound and stately impetuosity,
as if it were carrying a message from the mountains to the ocean!
The next morning we perceived that it was of a muddy colour. We
thought of passing down it in a small boat; but the covering was so
low as to make the posture uncomfortable, or, if raised higher, there
was a danger of its being overset by any sudden gust of wind. We
therefore went by the Diligence to Colmar and Strasburg. I
regretted afterwards that we did not take the right hand road by
Freybourg and the Black Forest—the woods, hills, and mouldering
castles of which, as far as I could judge from a distance, are the most
romantic and beautiful possible. The tower at Strasburg is red, and
has a singular appearance. The fortifications here, in time of peace,
have an effect like the stillness of death.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Rastadt.</span>—We crossed the Rhine at Strasburg, and proceeded
through Rastadt and Manheim to Mayence. We stopped the first
night at the Golden Cross at Rastadt, which is the very best inn I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>was at during the whole time I was abroad. Among other things,
we had <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chiffrons</span></i> for supper, which I found on inquiry were wood-partridges,
which are much more highly esteemed than the field ones.
So delicately do they distinguish in Germany! Manheim is a
splendid town, both from its admirable buildings and the glossy
neatness of the houses. They are too fine to live in, and seem only
made to be looked at. Would that one of the streets could be set
down in Waterloo-place! Yet even Manheim is not equal to the
towns in Italy. There the houses are palaces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mayence is a disagreeable town. We half missed the scenery
between this and Coblentz, the only part of the Rhine worth seeing.
We saw it, however, by moonlight (which hung over it like a silver
veil), with its nodding towers and dismantled fortresses over our
heads, the steep woody banks on the opposite side, and the broad
glittering surface of the Rhine, reflecting the white clouds or dark sail
gliding by. It was like a brilliant dream; nor did the mellow
winding notes of the horn, calling to the warders of the drawbridges
as we passed along, lessen the effect. Ehrenbreitstein overlooks
Coblentz, and crowns it with magnificence and beauty. The Duke
of Wellington, I understood, had been here, and being asked by
a French officer, ‘If it could be taken?’ answered, ‘Yes; in two
ways, by hunger and gold.’ Did the Duke of Wellington make
this answer? I cry you mercy—it was the Frenchman who gave the
answer: the Duke said nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cologne is the birth-place of Rubens; and at one of the churches,
there is a <cite>Crucifixion</cite> by him, which we did not see, for it being the
time of divine service, the back was turned to the spectator, and only
a copy of it was exhibited. The road from Cologne to Neuss is the
only really bad one we found on the Continent; it is a mere sand-bank,
and not likely to be soon mended, from its vicinity to the
Rhine.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Neuss to Cleves we went in the Royal Prussian Diligence,
and from thence to Nimeguen, the first town in Holland. From a
small tower here we had an admirable view of the country. It was
nearly a perfect flat all round, as far as the eye could reach; yet it
was a rich and animated, as well as a novel scene. You saw a greater
extent of surface than is possible in a hilly country; all within the
circumference of the horizon lay exposed to the eye. It was like
seeing a section of the entire globe, or like ‘striking flat its thick
rotundity.’ It was a fine clear afternoon, and in the midst of this
uniformity of surface, you saw every other variety—rich meadows,
with flocks and herds feeding, hedge-rows, willowy banks, woods,
corn-fields, roads winding along in different directions, canals, boats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>sailing, innumerable villages, windmills, bridges, and towns and cities
in the far-off horizon; but neither rock, nor mountain, nor barren
waste, nor any object that prevented your seeing the one beyond it.
There were no contrasts, no masses, but the immense space stretched
out beneath the eye was filled up with dotted lines, and minute,
detached, countless beauties. It was as if the earth were curiously
fringed and embroidered. Holland is the same everywhere, except
that it is often more intersected by canals; and that as you approach
the sea, the water prevails over the land. We proceeded from
Nimeguen to Utrecht and Amsterdam, by the stage. The rich
uninterrupted cultivation, the marks of successful industry and smiling
plenty, are equally commendable and exhilarating; but the repetition
of the same objects, and the extent of <em>home</em> view, become at last
oppressive. If you see much at once, there ought to be masses and
relief: if you see only detached objects, you ought to be confined to
a few of them at a time. What is the use of seeing a hundred windmills,
a hundred barges, a hundred willow-trees, or a hundred herds
of cattle at once? Any one specimen is enough, and the others hang
like a dead-weight on the traveller’s patience. Besides, there is something
lumpish and heavy in the aspect of the country; the eye is
clogged and impeded in its progress over it by dams and dykes, and
the marshy nature of the soil damps and chills imagination. There
is a like extent of country at Cassel in France; but from the greater
number of woods and a more luxuriant vegetation (leaving the bare
earth seldom visible,) the whole landscape seems in one glow, and the
eye scours delighted over waving groves and purple distances. The
towns and villas in Holland are unrivalled for neatness, and an appearance
of wealth and comfort. All the way from Utrecht to Amsterdam,
to the Hague, to Rotterdam, you might fancy yourself on Clapham
Common. The canals are lined with farms and summer-houses, with
orchards and gardens of the utmost beauty, and in excellent taste.
The exterior of their buildings is as clean as the interior of ours;
their public-houses look as nice and well-ordered as our private ones.
If you are up betimes in a morning, you see a servant wench (the
domestic Naiad,) with a leathern pipe, like that attached to a fire-engine,
drenching the walls and windows with pail-fulls of water.
With all this, they suffocate you with tobacco smoke in their stage-coaches
and canal-boats, and you do not see a set of clean teeth from
one end of Holland to the other. Amsterdam did not answer our
expectations; it is a kind of paltry, rubbishly Venice. The pictures
of Rembrandt here (some of which have little shade) are inferior to
what we have in England. I was assured here that Rembrandt was
the greatest painter in the world, and at Antwerp that Rubens was.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>The inn at Amsterdam (the Rousland) is one of the best I have been
at; and an inn is no bad test of the civilization and diffusion of
comfort in a country. We saw a play at the theatre here; and the
action was exceedingly graceful and natural. The chimes at Amsterdam,
which play every quarter of an hour, at first seemed gay and
delightful, and in a day and a half became tedious and intolerable.
It was as impertinent as if a servant could not come into the room to
answer the bell without dancing and jumping over the chairs and
tables every time. A row of lime-trees grew and waved their
branches in the middle of the street facing the hotel. The Dutch,
who are not an ideal people, bestow all their taste and fancy on
practical things, and instead of creating the chimeras of poetry, devote
their time and thoughts to embellishing the objects of ordinary and
familiar life. Ariosto said, it was easier to build palaces with words,
than common houses with stones. The Hague is Hampton-Court
turned into a large town. There is an excellent collection of pictures
here, with some of my old favourites brought back from the Louvre,
by Rembrandt, Vandyke, Paul Potter, &amp;c. Holland is, perhaps, the
only country which you gain nothing by seeing. It is exactly the
same as the Dutch landscapes of it. I was shewn the plain and
village of Ryswick, close to the Hague. It struck me I had seen
something very like it before. It is the back-ground of Paul Potter’s
<cite>Bull</cite>. From the views and models of Chinese scenery and buildings
preserved in the Museum here, it would seem that Holland is the
China of Europe. Delft is a very model of comfort and polished
neatness. We met with a gentleman belonging to this place in the
<em>trackschuyt</em>, who, with other civilities, shewed us his house (a perfect
picture in its kind,) and invited us in to rest and refresh ourselves,
while the other boat was getting ready. These things are an extension
of one’s idea of humanity. It is pleasant, and one of the uses of
travel, to find large tracts of land cultivated, cities built and repaired,
all the conveniences of life, men, women, and children laughing,
talking, and happy, common sense and good manners on the other
side of the English channel. I would not wish to lower any one’s
idea of England; but let him enlarge his notions of existence and
enjoyment beyond it. He will not think the worse of his own
country, for thinking better of human nature! The inconveniences
of travelling by canal-boats in Holland is, that you make little way,
and are forced to get out and have your luggage taken into another
boat at every town you come to, which happens two or three times in
the course of the day. Let no one go to the Washington Arms at
Rotterdam; it is only fit for American sea-captains. Rotterdam is a
handsome bustling town; and on inquiring our way, we were accosted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>by a Dutch servant-girl, who had lived in an English family for a
year, and who spoke English better, and with less of a foreign accent,
than any French woman I ever heard. This convinced me that
German is not so difficult to an Englishman as French; for the
difficulty of acquiring any foreign language must be mutual to the
natives of each country. There was a steam-boat here which set sail
for London the next day; but we preferred passing through Ghent,
Lille, and Antwerp. This last is a very delightful city, and the
spire of the cathedral exquisitely light, beautiful, and well-proportioned.
Indeed, the view of the whole city from the water-side is as singular
as it is resplendent. We saw the Rubenses in the great church here.
They were hung outside the choir; and seen against the huge white
walls, looked like pictures dangling in a broker’s shop for sale. They
did not form a part of the building. The person who shewed us the
Taking Down from the Cross, said, ‘It was the finest picture in the
world.’ I said, ‘One of the finest’—an answer with which he
appeared by no means satisfied. We returned by way of St. Omers
and Calais. I wished to see Calais once more, for it was here I
first landed in France twenty years ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>I confess, London looked to me on my return like a long, straggling,
dirty country-town; nor do the names of Liverpool, Manchester,
Birmingham, Leeds, or Coventry, sound like a trumpet in the ears,
or invite our pilgrim steps like those of Sienna, of Cortona, Perugia,
Arezzo, Pisa and Ferrara. I am not sorry, however, that I have
got back. There is an old saying, <em>Home is home, be it never so homely</em>.
However delightful or striking the objects may be abroad, they do
not take the same hold of you, nor can you identify yourself with
them as at home. Not only is the language an insuperable obstacle;
other things as well as men speak a language new and strange to you.
You live comparatively in a dream, though a brilliant and a waking
one. It is in vain to urge that you learn the language; that you are
familiarized with manners and scenery. No other language can ever
become our mother-tongue. We may learn the words; but they do
not convey the same feelings, nor is it possible they should do so,
unless we could begin our lives over again, and divide our conscious
being into two different selves. Not only can we not attach the same
meaning to words, but we cannot see objects with the same eyes, or
form new loves and friendships after a certain period of our lives.
The pictures that most delighted me in Italy were those I had before
seen in the Louvre ‘with eyes of youth.’ I could revive this feeling
of enthusiasm, but not transfer it. Neither would I recommend the
going abroad when young, to become a mongrel being, half French,
half English. It is better to be something than nothing. It is well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>to see foreign countries to enlarge one’s speculative knowledge, and
dispel false prejudices and libellous views of human nature; but our
affections must settle at home. Besides though a dream, it is a
splendid one. It is fine to see the white Alps rise in the horizon of
fancy at the distance of a thousand miles; or the imagination may
wing its thoughtful flight among the castellated Apennines, roaming
from city to city over cypress and olive grove, viewing the inhabitants
as they crawl about mouldering palaces or temples, which no hand
has touched for the last three hundred years, and see the genius of
Italy brooding over the remains of virtue, glory and liberty, with
Despair at the gates, an English Minister handing the keys to a
foreign Despot, and stupid Members of Parliament wondering what
is the matter!</p>

<p class='c008'>ON HAYDON’S SOLOMON</p>

<p class='c000'>The Tenth Exhibition of the Society of Painters in Oil and
Water Colours opened on Monday last. The productions of Glover,
Cristall, De Wint, &amp;c. principally fill and adorn the Water Colour
Department.—Among the oil pictures in the room, the principal are,
<cite>The Judgment of Solomon</cite>, by Mr. Haydon, and <cite>Don Quixote receiving
Mambrino’s Helmet from Sancho</cite>, by Mr. Richter. The former is a
work that evidently claims a place in the higher department of art;
and we are little disposed to reject that claim. It certainly shews a
bold and aspiring mind; in many parts (that which we hold above
all other things to be essential to the painter) an eye for the picturesque
both in form and colour; considerable variety of expression, attitude
and character, and great vigour and rapidity of execution throughout.
It would, at the same time, be in vain to deny, that the success is not
always in proportion to the effort made; that the conception of
character is sometimes erroneous; that the desire to avoid insipidity
and monotony has occasionally led to extravagance and distortion;
that there are great inequalities in the style, and some inconsistencies
in the composition; and that, however striking and admirable many
of the parts are, there is a want of union and complete harmony
between them. What was said of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra poetæ</span></i> is not
inapplicable to this picture. It exhibits fine studies and original
fragments of a great work—it has many powerful starts of genius—without
conveying that impression of uniform consistency and combined
effect, which is sometimes attained by the systematic mechanism of
well-disciplined dullness, and at others is the immediate emanation
of genius.</p>

<p class='c000'>That which strikes the eye most on entering the room, and on
which it dwells with the greatest admiration afterwards, are the
figures of the two Jewish Doctors on the left of Solomon. We
do not recollect any figures in modern pictures which have a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>striking effect. We say this, not only with respect to the solid mass
of colour which they project on the eye, the dark draperies contrasting
finely with the paleness of the countenances, but also with respect to
the force, truth, and dramatic opposition of character displayed in
them. The face of the one is turned in anxious expectation towards
the principal actors in the scene: the other, looking downwards,
appears lost in inward meditation upon it. The one is eagerly
watching for the catastrophe,—the other seems endeavouring to
anticipate it. Too much praise cannot be given to the conception
of the figure of Solomon, which is raised above the rest of the
picture, and placed in the centre—the face fronting, and looking
down, the action balanced and suspended, and the face intended to
combine the different characters of youth, beauty, and wisdom.
Such is evidently the conception of the painter, which we think
equally striking and just; but we are by no means satisfied that he
has succeeded in embodying this idea, except as far as relates to the
design. The expression of the countenance of the youthful judge,
which ought to convey the feeling of calm penetration, we think,
degenerates into supercilious indifference; the action given to the
muscles is such as to destroy the beauty of the features, without
giving force to the character, and instead of the majesty of conscious
power and intellect, there is an appearance of languid indecision,
which seems to shrink with repugnance from the difficulties which
it has to encounter. The colouring of the head is unexceptionable.
In the face of the good mother, the artist has, in our opinion,
succeeded in overcoming that which has been always considered as
the greatest difficulty of the art—the union of beauty with strong
expression. The whole face exhibits the internal workings of
maternal love and fear; but its death-like paleness and agony do
not destroy the original character of feminine beauty and delicacy.
The attitude of this figure is decidedly bad, and out of nature as
well as decorum. It is one of those sprawling, extravagant, theatrical
French figures, in which a common action is strained to the extremity
of caricature. The action and expression of the executioner are
liable to the same objection. He is turbulent and fierce, instead of
being cold and obdurate. He should not bluster in the part heroically
like an actor—it is his office.—On the whole, we think this
picture decidedly superior to any of this Artist’s former productions,
and a proof not only of genius, but of improved taste and judgment.
In speaking of it with freedom, we trust we shall best serve both him
and the art.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>THE CATALOGUE RAISONNÉ OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We will lay odds that this is a fellow ‘damned in a fair face;’
with white eyes and eye-brows; of the colour of a Shrewsbury cake;
a smooth tallow-skinned rascal, a white German sausage, a well-fed
chitterling, from whose face Madame de —— would have turned
away in disgust,—a transcendental stuffed man! We have no
patience that the Arts should be catechised by a piece of whitleather,
a whey-face, who thinks that pictures, like the moon,
should be made of green-cheese! Shall a roll of double tripe rise
up in judgment on grace; shall a piece of dough talk of feeling?
‘Tis too much. ‘Sdeath, for Rembrandt to be demanded of a
cheese-curd, what replication should he make? What might
Vandyke answer to a jack-pudding, whose fingers are of a thickness
at both ends? What should Rubens say, who ‘lived in the rainbow,
and played i’ th’ plighted clouds,’ to a swaddling-clout, a piece of
stockinet, of fleecy hosiery, to a squab man, without a bend in his
body? What might Raphael answer to a joint-stool? Or Nicholas
Poussin, charged in the presence of his <cite>Cephalus and Aurora</cite> with
being a mere pedant, without grace or feeling, to this round-about
machine of formal impertinence, this lumbering go-cart of dulness
and spite? We could have wished that as the fellow stood before
the portrait of Rembrandt, chattering like an ape, making mocks
and mows at it, the picture had lifted up its <em>great grimy fist</em>, and
knocked him down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> of the British Institution is only worth
notice, as it is pretty well understood to be a declaration of the
views of the Royal Academy. It is a very dull, gross, impudent
attack by one of its toad-eaters on human genius, on permanent
reputation, and on liberal art. What does it say? Why, in so
many words, that the knowledge of Art in this country is inconsistent
with the existence of the Academy, and that their success as a body
of men instituted for promoting and encouraging the Fine Arts,
requires the destruction or concealment of all works of Art of great
and acknowledged excellence. In this they may be right; but we
did not think they would have come forward to say so themselves.
Or that they would get a fellow, a low buffoon, a wretched Merry
Andrew, a practical St. Giles’s joker, a dirty Grub-Street critic, to
vent his abominations on the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> produced by the greatest
painters that have gone before them, to paw them over with his
bleared-eyes, to smear the filth and ordure of his tongue upon them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>to spit at them, to point at them, to nickname them, to hoot at them,
to make mouths at them, to shrug up his shoulders and run away
from them in the presence of these divine guests, like a blackguard
who affects to make a bugbear of every one he meets in the street;
to play over again the nauseous tricks of one of Swift’s Yahoos—and
for what? Avowedly for the purpose of diverting the public
mind from the contemplation of all that genius and art can boast in
the lapse of ages, and to persuade the world that there is nothing in
Art that has been or ever will be produced worth looking at but the
gilt frames and red curtains at the Exhibition of the Royal Academy!
We knew before that they had no great genius for the Arts; but we
thought they might have some love of them in their hearts. They
here avow their rankling jealousy, hatred and scorn, of all Art and
of all the great names in Art, and as a bold put indeed, require the
keeping down of the public taste as the only means of keeping up
the bubble of their reputation. They insist that their only hope of
continued encouragement and support with a <em>discerning public</em> is in
hood-winking that public, in confining their highest notions of Art
to their own gross and superficial style of daubing, and in vilifying all
works of standard genius.—This is right English. The English are
a shop-keeping nation, and the Royal Academy are a society of
hucksters in the Fine Arts, who are more tenacious of their profits as
chapmen and dealers, than of the honour of the Art. The day after
the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> was published, the Prince Regent, in the
name and on behalf of his Father, should have directed it to be
burned by the hands of the hangman of their Committee, or, upon
refusal, have shut up their shop. A society for the encouragement
and promotion of Art has no right to exist at all, from the moment
that it professes to exist only in wrong of Art, by the suppression of
the knowledge of Art, in contempt of genius in Art, in defiance
of all manly and liberal sentiment in Art. But this is what the
Royal Academy professes to do in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Academy, from its commencement and up to the present hour,
is in fact, a mercantile body, like any other mercantile body, consisting
chiefly of manufacturers of portraits, who have got a regular
monopoly of this branch of trade, with a certain rank, style, and title
of their own, that is, with the King’s privilege to be thought Artists
and men of genius,—and who, with the jealousy natural to such bodies,
supported by authority from without, and by cabal within, think themselves
bound to crush all generous views and liberal principles of Art,
lest they should interfere with their monopoly and their privilege to
be thought Artists and men of genius. The Academy is the Royal
road to Art. The whole style of English Art, as issuing from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Academy, is founded on a principle of appeal to the personal vanity
and ignorance of their sitters, and of accommodation to the lucrative
pursuits of the Painter, in a sweeping attention to effect in painting,
by which means he can cover so many more whole or half lengths in
each season. The Artists have not time to finish their pictures, or
if they had, the effect would be lost in the superficial glare of that
hot room, where nothing but rouged cheeks, naked shoulders, and
Ackermann’s dresses for May, can catch the eye in the crowd and
bustle and rapid succession of meretricious attractions, as they do in
another hot room of the same equivocal description. Yet they
complain in one part of the Catalogue, that ‘they (the Academicians)
are forced to come into a hasty competition every year with works
that have stood the test of ages.’ It is for that very reason, among
others, that it was proper to exhibit the works at the British
Institution, to show to the public, and by that means to make the
Academicians feel, that the securing the applause of posterity and a
real rank in the Art, which that alone can give, depended on the
number of pictures they finished, and not on the number they began.
It is this which excites the apprehensions of the cabal; for if the
eye of the public should be once spoiled by the Old Masters, the
necessity of doing something like them might considerably baulk
the regularity of their returns. Why should they complain of being
forced into this premature competition? Who forces them to bring
forward so many pictures yearly before they are fit to be seen?
Would they have taken more pains, more time to finish them, to
work them up to that fastidious standard of perfection, on which they
have set their minds, if they had not been hurried into this unfair
competition with the British Institution, ‘sent to their account with
all their imperfections on their heads, unhouseled, unanointed,
unanealed?’ Would they have done a single stroke more to any
one picture, if the Institution had never been opened? No such
thing. It is not then true, that this new and alarming competition
prevents them from finishing their works, but it prevents them from
imposing them on the public as finished. <em>Pingo in eternitatem</em>, is not
their motto. There are three things which constitute the art of
painting, which make it interesting to the public, which give it
permanence and rank among the efforts of human genius. They are,
first, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> or expression: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the conveying to the eye the impressions
of the soul, or the other senses connected with the sense
of sight, such as the different passions visible in the countenance, the
romantic interest connected with scenes of nature, the character and
feelings associated with different objects. In this, the highest and
first part of art, the Italian painters, particularly Raphael, Correggio,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>&amp;c., excel. The second is the <em>picturesque</em>; that is, the seizing on
those objects, or situations and accidents of objects, as light and
shade, &amp;c. which make them most striking to the mind as objects
of sight only. This is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i> of the Flemish and Venetian painters,
Titian, Paul Veronese, Rubens, Vandyke, Rembrandt, and they
have carried this part of the art as high as it can go, some of them
with more, some of them with less of the former excellence. The
third is the exact and laborious imitation of natural objects, such as
they exist in their component parts, with every variety and nicety
of detail, the pencil performing the part of a microscope, and there
being no necessity for expression or the picturesque in the object
represented, or anything but truth in the representation. In this
least interesting but still curious and ingenious part of the Art, the
Dutch School have been allowed to excel, though with little of
the former qualities, which indeed are not very much wanted for
this purpose. Now in all these three the English School are
notoriously deficient and they are so for these following reasons:—</p>

<p class='c000'>They cannot paint <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i>, or high expression, for it is not in the
national character. At least, it must be sought in Nature; but our
Painters do not go out of their way in search of character and
expression—their sitters come to them in crowds; and they come
to them not to be painted in all the truth of character and expression,
but to be <em>flattered</em> out of all meaning; or they would no longer come in
crowds. To please generally, the Painter must exaggerate what is
generally pleasing, obvious to all capacities, and void of offence before
God and man, the shewy, the superficial, and the insipid, that
which strikes the greatest number of persons with the least effort of
thought; and he must suppress all the rest; all that might be ‘to
the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Gentiles foolishness.’ The
Exhibition is a successful experiment on the ignorance and credulity
of the town. They collect ‘a quantity of barren spectators’ to
judge of Art, in their corporate and public capacity, and then each
makes the best market he can of them in his own. A Royal
Academician must not ‘hold the mirror up to Nature,’ but make his
canvass ‘the glass of fashion, and the mould of form.’ The ‘numbers
without number’ who pay thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred guineas
for their pictures in large, expect their faces to come out of the
Painter’s hands smooth, rosy, round, smiling; just as they expect
their hair to come out of the barber’s curled and powdered. It
would be a breach of contract to proceed in any other way. A
fashionable Artist and a fashionable hair-dresser have the same
common principles of theory and practice; the one fits his customers
to appear with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</span></i> in a ball room, the other in the Great Room of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the Royal Academy. A certain dexterity, and a knowledge of the
prevailing fashion, are all that is necessary to either. An Exhibition-portrait
is, therefore, an essence, not of character, but of commonplace.
It displays not high thought and fine feeling, but physical
well-being, with an outside label of health, ease, and competence.
Yet the Catalogue-writer talks of the dignity of modern portrait!
To enter into a general obligation to paint the passions or characters
of men, must, where there are none, be difficult to the artist; where
they are bad, be disagreeable to his employers. When Sir Thomas
Lawrence painted Lord Castlereagh some time ago, he did not try
to exhibit his character, out of complaisance to his Lordship, nor
his understanding, out of regard to himself; but he painted him in
a fashionable coat, with his hair dressed in the fashion, in a genteel
posture like one of his footmen, and with the prim, smirking aspect
of a haberdasher. There was nothing of the noble <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">disinvoltura</span></i> of
his Lordship’s manner, the grand <em>contour</em> of his features, the profundity
of design hid under an appearance of indifference, the traces
of the Irish patriot or the English statesman. It would have puzzled
Lavater or Spurzheim to have discovered there the author of the
Letter to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon Prince</span></i>. Tacitus had drawn him before in a different
style, and perhaps Sir Thomas despaired of rivalling this great master
in his own way. Yet the picture pleased, and Mr. Perry of the
<cite>Chronicle</cite> swore to the likeness, though he had been warned to the
contrary. Now, if this picture had erred on the side of the
characteristic expression as much as it did on that of mannered
insignificance, how it must have shocked all parties in the State!
An insipid misrepresentation was safer than a disagreeable reality.
In the glosses of modern art, as in the modern refinement of law, it
is the truth that makes the libel.—Again, the <em>picturesque</em> is necessarily
banished from the painting rooms of the Academicians, and from
the Great Room of the Academy. People of fashion go to be
painted because other people do, and they wish to look like other
people. We never remember to have seen a memorable head in the
Exhibition of the Royal Academy. Any thing that had any thing
singular or striking in it would look quite monstrous there, and would
be stared out of countenance. Any thing extraordinary or original in
nature is inadmissible in modern art; any thing that would strike the
eye, or that you would ever think of again, would be a violation of
decorum, an infringement of professional etiquette, and would disturb
the uniform and well-arranged monotony of the walls of the Exhibition
‘with most admired disorder.’ A man of any originality of mind,
if he has also the least common sense, soon finds his error, and
reforms. At Rome one must do as the people at Rome do. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Academy is not the place for the eccentricities of genius. The
persons of rank and opulence, who wish to have their pictures
exhibited, do not wish to be exhibited as objects of natural history,
as extraordinary phenomena in art or nature, in the moral or
intellectual world; and in this they are right. Neither do they
wish to volunteer their own persons, which they hold in due
reverence, though there is nothing at all in them, as subjects for
the painter to exercise his skill upon, as studies of light and shade,
as merely objects of sight, as something curious and worth seeing
from the outward accidents of nature. They do not like to share
their triumph with nature; to sink their persons in ‘her glorious light.’
They owe no allegiance to the elements. They wish to be painted
as Mr. and Mrs. Such-a-one, not as studies of light and shade; they
wish to be represented as complete abstractions of persons and
property, to have one side of the face seen as much as the other; to
have their coat, waistcoat and breeches, their muslin dresses, silks,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sophas</span>, and settees, their dogs and horses, their house furniture,
painted, to have themselves and all that belongs to them, and
nothing else painted. The picture is made for them, and not they
for the picture. Hence there can be nothing but the vapid, trite,
and mechanical, in professional Art. Professional Art is a contradiction
in terms. Art is genius, and genius cannot belong to a profession.
Our Painters’ galleries are not studies, but lounging shew-rooms.
Would a booby with a star wish to be painted (think you) with
a view to its effect in the picture, or would he not have it seen at
all events and as much as possible? The Catalogue Writer wishes
the gentlemen-sitters of the Royal Academy to go and look at
Rembrandt’s portraits, and to ask themselves, their wives, and
daughters, whether they would like to be painted in the same way?
No, truly. This, we confess, is hard upon our Artists, to have to
look upon splendour and on obscurity still more splendid, which they
dare not even attempt to imitate; to see themselves condemned, by
the refinements of taste and progress of civilization, to smear rouge
and white paste on the faces and necks of their portraits, for ever;
and still ‘to let <em>I dare not</em> wait upon <em>I would</em>, like the poor cat in
the adage.’ But why then complain of the injury they would sustain
by the restoration of Art (if it were possible) into the original
wardship of nature and genius, when ‘service sweat for duty, not
for meed.’ Sir Joshua made a shift to combine some of Rembrandt’s
art with his portraits, only by getting the start of public affectation,
and by having the lead in his profession, so that like the early
painters he could assert the independence of his own taste and
judgment. The modern makers of catalogues would have driven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>him and his <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro scuro</span></i> into the shade presently. The critic professes
to admire Sir Joshua, though all his excellencies are Gothic, palpably
borrowed from the Old Masters. But he is wrong or inconsistent
in everything.—The imitation of the details of nature is not compatible
with the professional avarice of the painter, as the two former
essentials of the art are inconsistent with the vanity and ignorance of
his employers. ‘This, this is the unkindest blow of all.’ It is that
in which the understanding of the multitude is most likely to conspire
with the painter’s ‘own gained knowledge’ to make him dissatisfied
with his disproportioned profits or under the loss of them. The Dutch
masters are instructive enough in this way, and shew the value of detail
by shewing the value of Art where there is nothing else but this. But
this is not all. It might be pretended by our wholesale manufacturers
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> in the Fine Arts, that so much nicety of execution
is useless or improper in works of high gusto and grand effect. It
happens unfortunately, however, that the works of the greatest gusto
and most picturesque effect have this fidelity of imitation often in
the highest degree (as in Raphael, Titian, and Rembrandt), generally
in a very high degree (as in Rubens and Paul Veronese), so that
the moderns gain nothing by this pretext. This is a serious loss of
time or reputation to them. To paint a hand like Vandyke would
cost them as much time as a dozen half-lengths; and they could not
do it after all. To paint an eye like Titian would cost them their
whole year’s labour, and they would lose their time and their labour
into the bargain. Or to take Claude’s landscapes as an example in
this respect, as they are in almost all others. If Turner, whom,
with the Catalogue-writer, we allow, most heartily allow, to be the
greatest landscape-painter of the age, were to finish his trees or his
plants in the foreground, or his distances, or his middle distances, or
his sky, or his water, or his buildings, or any thing in his pictures, in
like manner, he could only paint and sell one landscape where he
now paints and sells twenty. This is a clear loss to the artist
of pounds, shillings, and pence, and ‘that’s a feeling disputation.’
He would have to put twenty times as much of every thing into a
picture as he now has, and that is what (if he is like other persons
who have got into bad habits) he would be neither able nor willing
to do. It was a common cant a short time ago to pretend of him
as it formerly was of Wilson, that he had other things which Claude
had not, and that what Claude had besides, only impaired the
grandeur of his pictures. The public have seen to the contrary.
They see the quackery of painting trees blue and yellow, to produce
the effect of green at a distance. They see the affectation of
despising the mechanism of the Art, and never thinking about any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>thing but the mechanism. They see that it is not true in Art, that
a part is greater than the whole, or that the means are destructive of
the end. They see that a daub, however masterly, cannot vie with
the perfect landscapes of the all-accomplished Claude. ‘To some
men their graces serve them but as enemies’; and it was so till the
other day with Claude. If it had been only for opening the eyes
of the public on this subject, the Institution would have deserved well
of the art and their country.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>WEST’S PICTURE OF DEATH ON THE PALE HORSE</h3>

<p class='c008'>Mr. West’s name stands deservedly high in the annals of art in
this country—too high for him to condescend to be his own puffer,
even at second-hand. He comes forward, in the present instance, as
the painter and the showman of the piece; as the candidate for public
applause, and the judge who awards himself the prize; as the idol on
the altar, and the priest who offers up the grateful incense of praise.
He places himself, as it were, before his own performance, with a
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> in his hand, and, before the spectator can form
a judgment on the work itself, dazzles him with an account of the
prodigies of art which are there conceived and executed. This is
not quite fair. It is a proceeding which, though ‘it sets on a quantity
of barren spectators to <em>admire</em>, cannot but make the judicious
grieve.’ Mr. West, by thus taking to himself unlimited credit for
the ‘high endeavour and the glad success,’ by proclaiming aloud that
he has aimed at the highest sublimities of his art, and as loudly, with
a singular mixture of pomposity and phlegm, that he has fully accomplished
all that his most ardent hopes had anticipated,—must, we
should think, obtain a great deal of spurious, catchpenny reputation,
and lose a great deal of that genuine tribute of approbation to which
he is otherwise entitled, by turning the attention of the well-informed
and unprejudiced part of the community from his real and undoubted
merits to his groundless and exaggerated pretensions. <em>Self-praise</em>, it
is said, <em>is no praise</em>; but it is worse than this. It either shows great
weakness and vanity for an artist to talk (or to get another to talk)
of his own work, which was produced yesterday, and may be forgotten
to-morrow, with the same lofty, emphatic, solemn tone, as if it were
already stamped with the voice of ages, and had become sacred to the
imagination of the beholder; or else the doing so is a deliberate
attempt to encroach on the right of private judgment and public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>opinion, which those who are not its dupes will resent accordingly,
and endeavour to repel by acts of precaution or hostility. An
unsuccessful effort to extort admiration is sure to involve its own
punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>We should not have made these remarks, if the ‘Description of the
Picture of Death’ had been a solitary instance of the kind; but it is
one of a series of descriptions of the same sort—it is a part of a
system of self-adulation which cannot be too much discouraged.
Perhaps Mr. West may say, that the Descriptive Catalogue is not <em>his</em>;
that he has nothing to do with its composition or absurdities. But it
must be written with his consent and approbation; and this is a
sanction which it ought not to receive. We presume the artist would
have it in his option to put a negative on any undue censure or
flagrant abuse of his picture; it must be equally in his power, and it
is equally incumbent upon him, to reject, with dignified modesty, the
gross and palpable flatteries which it contains, direct or by implication.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first notice we received of this picture was by an advertisement
in a morning paper, (the editor of which is not apt to hazard
extravagant opinions without a prompter,) purporting that, ‘in consequence
of the President’s having devoted a year and a half to its
completion, and of its having for its subject the <em>Terrible Sublime</em>, it
would place Great Britain in the same conspicuous relation to the
rest of Europe in arts, that the battle of Waterloo had done in arms!’
We shall not stay to decide between the battle and the picture; but
the writer follows up the same idea of the <em>Terrible Sublime</em> in the
Catalogue, the first paragraph of which is conceived in the following
terms:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The general effect proposed to be excited by this picture is the
terrible sublime, and its various modifications, until lost in the opposite
extremes of pity and horror, a sentiment which painting has so seldom
attempted to awaken, that a particular description of the subject will
probably be acceptable to the public.’</p>

<p class='c000'>‘So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery.’ Mr. West
here, like Bayes in the ‘Rehearsal,’ <em>insinuates the plot</em> very profoundly.
He has, it seems, opened a new walk in art with its
alternate ramifications into the opposite regions of horror and pity,
and kindly takes the reader by the hand, to show him how triumphantly
he has arrived at the end of his journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘In poetry,’ continues the writer, ‘the same effect is produced by
a few abrupt and rapid gleams of description, touching, as it were,
with fire, the features and edges of a general mass of awful obscurity;
but in painting, such indistinctness would be a defect, and imply, that
the artist wanted the power to pourtray the conceptions of his fancy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Mr. West was of opinion that to delineate a physical form, which in
its moral impression would approximate to that of the visionary Death
of Milton, it was necessary to endow it, if possible, with the appearance
of superhuman strength and energy. He has, therefore, exerted
the utmost force and perspicuity of his pencil on the central figure.’
This is ‘spoken with authority, and not as the scribes.’ Poetry,
according to the definition here introduced of it, resembles a candlelight
picture, which gives merely the rim and outlines of things in a
vivid and dazzling, but confused and imperfect manner. We cannot
tell whether this account will be considered as satisfactory. But
Mr. West, or his commentator, should tread cautiously on this
ground. He may otherwise commit himself, not only in a comparison
with the epic poet, but with the inspired writer, who only
uses <em>words</em>. It will hardly be contended, for instance, that the
account of Death on the Pale Horse in the book of Revelations,
never produced its due effect of <em>the terrible sublime</em>, till the deficiencies
of the pen were supplied by the pencil. Neither do we see how the
endowing a physical form with superhuman strength, has any necessary
connection with the <em>moral impression of the visionary Death of Milton</em>.
There seems to be here some radical mistake in Mr. West’s theory.
The moral attributes of death are powers and effects of an infinitely
wide and general description, which no individual or physical form can
possibly represent, but by courtesy of speech or by a distant analogy.
The moral impression of Death is essentially visionary; its reality is
in the mind’s eye. Words are here the only things; and things,
physical forms, the mere mockeries of the understanding. The less
definite the conception, the less bodily, the more vast, unformed, and
unsubstantial, the nearer does it approach to some resemblance of that
omnipresent, lasting, universal, irresistible principle, which everywhere,
and at some time or other, exerts its power over all things.
Death is a mighty abstraction, like Night, or Space, or Time. He is
an ugly customer, who will not be invited to supper, or to sit for his
picture. He is with us and about us, but we do not see him. He
stalks on before us, and we do not mind him; he follows us behind,
and we do not look back at him. We do not see him making faces
at us in our lifetime! we do not feel him tickling our bare ribs afterwards,
nor look at him through the empty grating of our hollow eyes!
Does Mr. West really suppose that he has put the very image of
Death upon his canvas; that he has taken the fear of him out of our
hearts; that he has circumscribed his power with a pair of compasses;
that he has measured the length of his arm with a two-foot rule; that
he has suspended the stroke of his dart with a stroke of his pencil;
that he has laid his hands on the universal principle of destruction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>and hemmed him in with lines and lineaments, and made a gazing-stock
and a show of him, ‘under the patronage of the Prince Regent’
(as that illustrious person has taken, and confined, and made a show
of another <em>enemy of the human race</em>)—so that the work of decay and
dissolution is no longer going on in nature; that all we have heard or
felt of death is but a fable compared with this distinct, living, and
warranted likeness of him? Oh no! There is no power in the
pencil actually to embody an abstraction, to impound the imagination,
to circumvent the powers of the soul, which hold communion
with the universe. The painter cannot make the general particular,
the infinite and imaginary defined and palpable, that which is only
believed and dreaded, an object of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Mr. West appears to have wrong notions of the powers of his
art, so he seems not to put in practice all that it is capable of. The
only way in which the painter of genius can represent the force of
moral truth, is by translating it into an artificial language of his own,—by
substituting hieroglyphics for words, and presenting the closest
and most striking affinities his fancy and observation can suggest
between the general idea and the visible illustration of it. Here we
think Mr. West has failed. The artist has represented Death riding
over his prostrate victims in all the rage of impotent despair. He is
in a great splutter, and seems making a last effort to frighten his foes
by an explosion of red-hot thunderbolts, and a pompous display of
his allegorical paraphernalia. He has not the calm, still, majestic
form of Death, killing by a look,—withering by a touch. His
presence does not make the still air cold. His flesh is not stony or
cadaverous, but is crusted over with a yellow glutinous paste, as if it
had been baked in a pye. Milton makes Death ‘grin horrible a
ghastly smile,’ with an evident allusion to the common Death’s head;
but in the picture he seems grinning for a wager, with a full row of
loose rotten teeth; and his terrible form is covered with a long black
drapery, which would cut a figure in an undertaker’s shop, and which
cuts a figure where it is (for it is finely painted), but which serves
only as a disguise for the King of Terrors. We have no idea of such
a swaggering and blustering Death as this of Mr. West’s. He has
not invoked a ghastly spectre from the tomb, but has called up an old
squalid ruffian from a night cellar, and crowned him ‘monarch of the
universal world.’ The horse on which he rides is not ‘pale,’ but
white. There is no gusto, no imagination in Mr. West’s colouring.
As to his figure, the description gives an accurate idea of it enough.
‘His horse rushes forward with the universal wildness of a tempestuous
element, breathing livid pestilence, and rearing and trampling
with the vehemence of unbridled fury.’ The style of the figure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>corresponds to the style of the description. It is overloaded and
top-heavy. The chest of the animal is a great deal too long for
the legs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The painter has made amends for this splashing figure of the Pale
Horse, by those of the White and Red Horse. They are like a
couple of rocking-horses, and go as easy. Mr. West’s vicarious
egotism obtrudes itself again offensively in speaking of the Rider on
the White Horse. ‘As he is supposed,’ says the Catalogue, ‘to
represent the Gospel, it was requisite that he should be invested with
those exterior indications of purity, excellence, and dignity, which
are associated in our minds with the name and offices of the Messiah.
But it was not <span class='sc'>THE Saviour</span> healing and comforting the afflicted, or
the meek and lowly <span class='sc'>Jesus</span>, bearing with resignation the scorn and
hatred of the scoffing multitude, that was to be represented;—it was
the King of Kings going forth, conquering and to conquer. He is
<em>therefore</em> painted with a solemn countenance, expressive of a mind
filled with the thoughts of a great enterprise; and he advances
onward in his sublime career with that serene Majesty,’ &amp;c. Now
this is surely an unwarrantable assumption of public opinion in a
matter of taste. Christ is not represented in this picture as he was in
Mr. West’s two former pictures; but in all three he gives you to
understand that he has reflected the true countenance and divine
character of the Messiah. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multum abludit imago.</span></i> The Christs in
each picture have a different character indeed, but they only present
a variety of meanness and insipidity. But the unwary spectator, who
looks at the catalogue to know what he is to think of the picture, and
reads all these <em>therefores</em> of <em>sublimity</em>, <em>serenity</em>, <em>purity</em>, &amp;c. considers
them as so many infallible inferences and demonstrations of the
painter’s skill.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. West has been tolerably successful in the delineation of the
neutral character of the ‘Man on the Black Horse;’ but ‘the two
wretched emaciated figures’ of a man and woman before him,
‘absorbed in the feelings of their own particular misery,’ are not
likely to excite any sympathy in the beholders. They exhibit the
lowest stage of mental and physical imbecility, that could never by
any possibility come to any good. In the domestic groupe in the
foreground, ‘the painter has attempted to excite the strongest degree
of pity which his subject admitted, and to contrast the surrounding
objects with images of tenderness and beauty;’ and it is here that he
has principally failed. The Dying Mother appears to have been in
her lifetime a plaster-cast from the antique, stained with a little purple
and yellow, to imitate the life. The ‘Lovely Infant’ that is falling
from her breast, is a hideous little creature, with glazed eyes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>livid aspect, borrowed from the infant who is falling out of his
mother’s lap over the bridge, in Hogarth’s Print of Gin-Lane. The
Husband’s features, who is placed in so pathetic an attitude, are cut
out of the hardest wood, and of the deepest dye; and the surviving
Daughter, who is stated ‘to be sensible only to the loss she has sustained
by the death of so kind a parent,’ is neither better nor worse
than the figures we meet with in the elegant frontispieces to history-books,
or family stories, intended as Christmas presents to good little
boys and girls. The foreshortening of the lower extremities, both
of the Mother and Child, is wretchedly defective, either in drawing
and colouring.</p>

<p class='c000'>In describing ‘the anarchy of the combats of men with beasts,’
Mr. West has attained that sort of excellence which always arises
from a knowledge of the rules of composition. His lion, however,
looks as if his face and velvet paws were covered with calf’s skin, or
leather gloves pulled carefully over them. So little is the appearance
of hair given! The youth in this group, whom Mr. West celebrates
for his muscular manly courage, has a fine rustic look of health and
strength about him; but we think the other figure, with scowling
swarthy face, striking at an animal, is superior in force of character
and expression. In the back figure of the man holding his hand to
his head, (with no very dignified action), the artist has well imitated
the bad colouring, and stiff inanimate drawing of Poussin. The
remaining figures are not of much importance, or are striking only
from their defects. Mr. West, however, omits no opportunity of
discreetly sounding his own praise. ‘The story of this group,’ it is
said, ‘would have been incomplete, had the lions <em>not</em> been shown
conquerors to a certain extent, by the two wounded men,’ &amp;c. As
it is, it is perfect! Admirable critic! Again we are told, ‘The
pyramidal form of this large division is <em>perfected</em> by a furious bull,’ &amp;c.
Nay, indeed, the form of the pyramid is even preserved in the title-page
of the catalogue. The prettiest incident in the picture is the
dove lamenting over its mate, just killed by the serpent. We do not
deny Mr. West the praise of invention. Upon the whole, we think
this the best coloured and most picturesque of all Mr. West’s productions;
and in all that relates to composition, and the introduction of
the adjuncts of historical design, it shows, like his other works, the
hand of a master. In the same room is the picture of Christ Rejected.
Alas! how changed, and in how short a time! The colours are
scarcely dry, and it already looks dingy, flat, and faded.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>ON WILLIAMS’S VIEWS IN GREECE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>There has been lately exhibited at the Calton Convening Room,
Edinburgh, a collection of views in Greece, Italy, Sicily, and the
Ionian Isles, painted in water colours by Mr. Hugh Williams, a
native of Scotland, which themselves do honour to the talents of the
artist, as the attention they have excited does to the taste of the
northern capital. It is well; for the exhibition in that town of
the works of living artists (to answer to our Somerset-House
exhibition) required some set-off. Mr. Williams has made the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende honorable</span></i>, for his country, to the offended genius of art, and
has stretched out under the far-famed Calton Hill, and in the eye of
Arthur’s Seat, fairy visions of the fair land of Greece, that Edinburgh
belles and beaux repair to see with cautious wonder and well-regulated
delight. It is really a most agreeable novelty to the passing visitant
to see the beauty of the North, the radiant beauty of the North,
enveloped in such an atmosphere, and set off by such a back-ground.
Oriental skies pour their molten lustre on Caledonian charms. The
slender, lovely, taper waist (made more taper, more lovely, more
slender by the stay-maker), instead of being cut in two by the keen
blasts that rage in Prince’s street, is here supported by warm languid
airs, and a thousand sighs, that breathe from the vale of Tempe. Do
not those fair tresses look brighter as they are seen hanging over a
hill in Arcadia, than when they come in contact with the hard grey
rock of the castle? Do not those fair blue eyes look more translucent
as they glance over some classic stream? What can vie with
that alabaster skin but marble temples, dedicated to the Queen of
Love? What can match those golden freckles but glittering sun-sets
behind Mount Olympus? Here, in one corner of the room, stands
the Hill of the Muses, and there is a group of Graces under it!
There played the <span class='sc'>Nine</span> on immortal lyres, and here sit the critical
but admiring Scottish fair, with the catalogue in their hands, reading
the quotations from Lord Byron’s verses with liquid eyes and lovely
vermilion lips—would that they spoke English, or any thing but
Scotch!—Poor is this irony! Vain the attempt to reconcile Scottish
figures with Attic scenery! What land can rival Greece? What
earthly flowers can compare with the colours in the sky? What
living beauty can recall the dead? For in that word, <span class='sc'>Greece</span>, there
breathe three thousand years of fame that has no date to come!
Over that land hovers a light, brighter than that of suns, softer than
that which vernal skies shed on halcyon seas, the light that rises from
the tomb of virtue, genius, liberty! Oh! thou Uranian Venus, thou
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>that never art, but wast and art to be; thou that the eye sees not, but
that livest for ever in the heart; thou whom men believe and know
to be, for thou dwellest in the desires and longings, and hunger of the
mind; thou that art a Goddess, and we thy worshippers, say dost thou
not smile for ever on this land of Greece, and shed thy purple light over
it, and blend thy choicest blandishments with its magic name? But
here (in the Calton Convening Room, in Waterloo place, close under
the Melville monument—strange contradiction!) another Greece
grows on the walls—other skies are to be seen, ancient temples rise,
and modern Grecian ladies walk. Here towers Mount Olympus,
where Gods once sat—that is the top of a hill in Arcadia—(who
would think that the eyes would ever behold a form so visionary, that
they would ever see an image of that, which seems only a delicious
vanished sound?) this is Corinth—that is the Parthenon—there
stands Thebes in Bœotia—that is the Plain of Platæa,—yonder is the
city of Syracuse, and the Temple of Minerva Sunias, and there the
site of the gardens of Alcinous.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is Pope’s description of them in the Odyssey, which (we
must say) is very bad, and if Mr. Williams had not given us a more
distinct idea of the places he professes to describe, we should not have
gone out of our way to notice them. As works of art, these water-colour
drawings deserve very high praise. The drawing is correct
and characteristic: the colouring chaste, rich, and peculiar; the
finishing generally careful; and the selection of points of view striking
and picturesque. We have at once an impressive and satisfactory
idea of the country of which we have heard so much; and wish to
visit places which, it seems from this representation of them, would
not bely all that we have heard. Some splenetic travellers have pretended
that Attica was dry, flat, and barren. But it is not so in
Mr. Williams’s authentic draughts; and we thank him for restoring
to us our old, and, as it appears, true illusion—for crowning that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>Elysium of our school-boy fancies with majestic hills, and scooping it
into lovely winding valleys once more. Lord Byron is, we believe,
among those who have spoken ill of Greece, calling it a ‘sand-bank,’
or something of that sort. Every ill-natured traveller ought to hold
a pencil as well as a pen in his hand, and be forced to produce a
sketch of his own lie. As to the subjects of Mr. Williams’s pencil,
nothing can exceed the local interest that belongs to them, and which
he has done nothing, either through injudicious selection, or negligent
execution, to diminish. Quere. Is not this interest as great in
London as it is in Edinburgh? In other words, we mean to ask,
whether this exhibition would not answer well in London.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are a number of other very interesting sketches interspersed,
and some very pleasing <em>home</em> views, which seem to show that nature is

<p class='c000'>It is evident to any one who views these admirable remains of
Antiquity (nay, it is acknowledged by our artists themselves, in
despite of all the melancholy sophistry which they have been taught
or have been teaching others for half a century) that the chief
excellence of the figures depends on their having been copied from
nature, and not from imagination. The communication of art with
nature is here everywhere immediate, entire, palpable. The artist
gives himself no fastidious airs of superiority over what he sees. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>has not arrived, at that stage of his progress described at much length
in Sir Joshua Reynolds’s Discourses, in which having served out
his apprenticeship to nature, he can set up for himself in opposition to
her. According to the old Greek form of drawing up the indentures
in this case, we apprehend they were to last for life. At least, we
can compare these Marbles to nothing but human figures petrified:
they have every appearance of absolute <em>fac-similes</em> or casts taken from
nature. The details are those of nature; the masses are those of
nature; the forms are from nature; the action is from nature; the
whole is from nature. Let any one, for instance, look at the leg of
the Ilissus or River-God, which is bent under him—let him observe
the swell and undulation of the calf, the inter-texture of the muscles,
the distinction and union of all the parts, and the effect of action
every where impressed on the external form, as if the very marble were
a flexible substance, and contained the various springs of life and
motion within itself, and he will own that art and nature are here the
same thing. It is the same in the back of the Theseus, in the thighs
and knees, and in all that remains unimpaired of these two noble
figures. It is not the same in the cast (which was shown at Lord
Elgin’s) of the famous Torso by Michael Angelo, the style of which
that artist appears to have imitated too well. There every muscle
has obviously the greatest prominence and force given to it of which
it is capable in itself, not of which it is capable in connexion with
others. This fragment is an accumulation of mighty parts, without
that play and re-action of each part upon the rest, without that
‘alternate action and repose’ which Sir Thomas Lawrence speaks of
as characteristic of the Theseus and the Ilissus, and which are as
inseparable from nature as waves from the sea. The learned,
however, here make a distinction, and suppose that the truth of nature
is, in the Elgin Marbles, combined with ideal forms. If by <em>ideal
forms</em> they mean fine natural forms, we have nothing to object; but if
they mean that the sculptors of the Theseus and Ilissus got the forms
out of their own heads, and then tacked the truth of nature to them,
we can only say, ‘Let them look again, let them look again.’ We
consider the Elgin Marbles as a demonstration of the impossibility of
separating art from nature without a proportionable loss at every
remove. The utter absence of all setness of appearance proves that
they were done as studies from actual models. The separate parts of
the human body may be given from scientific knowledge:—their
modifications or inflections can only be learnt by seeing them in action;
and the truth of nature is incompatible with ideal form, if the latter
is meant to exclude actually existing form. The mutual action of
the parts cannot be determined where the object itself is not seen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>That the forms of these statues are not common nature, such as we
see it every day, we readily allow: that they were not select Greek
nature, we see no convincing reason to suppose. That truth of nature,
and ideal or fine form, are not always or generally united, we know;
but how they can ever be united in art, without being first united in
nature, is to us a mystery, and one that we as little believe as
understand!</p>

<p class='c000'>Suppose, for illustration’s sake, that these Marbles were originally
done as casts from actual nature, and then let us inquire whether they
would not have possessed all the same qualities that they now display,
granting only, that the forms were in the first instance selected with the
eye of taste, and disposed with knowledge of the art and of the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, the larger masses and proportions of entire limbs and divisions
of the body would have been found in the casts, for they would have
been found in nature. The back and trunk, and arms, and legs, and
thighs would have been there, for these are parts of the natural man
or actual living body, and not inventions of the artist, or <em>ideal</em> creations
borrowed from the skies. There would have been the same sweep in
the back of the Theseus; the same swell in the muscles of the arm
on which he leans; the same division of the leg into calf and small,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the same general results, or aggregation of parts, in the principal and
most striking divisions of the body. The upper part of the arm would
have been thicker than the lower, the thighs larger than the legs, the
body larger than the thighs, in a cast taken from common nature; and
in casts taken from the finest nature they would have been so in the
same proportion, form, and manner, as in the statue of the Theseus, if
the Theseus answers to the <em>idea</em> of the finest nature; for the idea and
the reality must be the same; only, we contend that the idea is taken
from the reality, instead of existing by itself, or being the creature of
fancy. That is, there would be the same grandeur of proportions
and parts in a cast taken from finely developed nature, such as the
Greek sculptors had constantly before them, naked and in action, that
we find in the limbs and masses of bone, flesh, and muscle, in these
much and justly admired remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, and incontestibly, there would have been, besides the
grandeur of form, all the <em>minutiæ</em> and individual details in the cast
that subsist in nature, and that find no place in the theory of <em>ideal</em> art—in
the omission of which, indeed, its very grandeur is made to
consist. The Elgin Marbles give a flat contradiction to this gratuitous
separation of grandeur of design and exactness of detail, as incompatible
in works of art, and we conceive that, with their whole
ponderous weight to crush it, it will be difficult to set this theory on
its legs again. In these majestic colossal figures, nothing is omitted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>nothing is made out by negation. The veins, the wrinkles in the
skin, the indications of the muscles under the skin (which appear as
plainly to the anatomist as the expert angler knows from an undulation
on the surface of the water what fish is playing with his bait
beneath it), the finger-joints, the nails, every the smallest part cognizable
to the naked eye, is given here with the same ease and exactness,
with the same prominence, and the same subordination, that it would
be in a cast from nature, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, in nature itself. Therefore, so far these
things, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, nature, a cast from it, and the Elgin Marbles, are the
same; and all three are opposed to the fashionable and fastidious
theory of the <em>ideal</em>. Look at Sir Joshua’s picture of Puck, one of
his finest-coloured, and most spirited performances. The fingers are
mere <em>spuds</em>, and we doubt whether any one can make out whether
there are four toes or five allowed to each of the feet. If there had
been a young Silenus among the Elgin Marbles, we don’t know that
in some particulars it would have surpassed Sir Joshua’s masterly
sketch, but we are sure that the extremities, the nails, &amp;c. would
have been studies of natural history. The life, the spirit, the character
of the grotesque and imaginary little being would not have made an
abortion of any part of his natural growth or form.</p>

<p class='c000'>Farther, in a cast from nature there would be, as a matter of
course, the same play and flexibility of limb and muscle, or, as Sir
Thomas Lawrence expresses it, the same ‘alternate action and repose,’
that we find so admirably displayed in the Elgin Marbles. It seems
here as if stone could move: where one muscle is strained, another is
relaxed, where one part is raised, another sinks in, just as in the
ocean, where the waves are lifted up in one place, they sink proportionally
low in the next: and all this modulation and affection of
the different parts of the form by others arise from an attentive and
co-instantaneous observation of the parts of a flexible body, where the
muscles and bones act upon, and communicate with, one another like
the ropes and pullies in a machine, and where the action or position
given to a particular limb or membrane naturally extends to the whole
body. This harmony, this combination of motion, this unity of spirit
diffused through the wondrous mass and every part of it, is the glory
of the Elgin Marbles:—put a well-formed human body in the same
position, and it will display the same character throughout; make a
cast from it while in that position and action, and we shall still see
the same bold, free, and comprehensive truth of design. There is no
alliteration or antithesis in the style of the Elgin Marbles, no setness,
squareness, affectation, or formality of appearance. The different
muscles do not present a succession of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumuli</span></i>, each heaving with big
throes to rival the other. If one is raised, the other falls quietly into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>its place. Neither do the different parts of the body answer to one
another, like shoulder-knots on a lacquey’s coat or the different
ornaments of a building. The sculptor does not proceed on
architectural principles. His work has the freedom, the variety, and
stamp of nature. The form of corresponding parts is indeed the
same, but it is subject to inflection from different circumstances.
There is no primness or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit maître-ship</span></i>, as in some of the later
antiques, where the artist seemed to think that flesh was glass or some
other brittle substance; and that if it were put out of its exact shape
it would break in pieces. Here, on the contrary, if the foot of one
leg is bent under the body, the leg itself undergoes an entire alteration.
If one side of the body is raised above the other, the original,
or abstract, or <em>ideal</em> form of the two sides is not preserved strict and
inviolable, but varies as it necessarily must do in conformity to the
law of gravitation, to which all bodies are subject. In this respect, a
cast from nature would be the same. Mr. Chantrey once made a
cast from Wilson the Black. He put him into an attitude at first,
and made the cast, but not liking the effect when done, got him to sit
again and made use of the plaister of Paris once more. He was
satisfied with the result; but Wilson, who was tired with going
through the operation, as soon as it was over, went and leaned upon a
block of marble with his hands covering his face. The sagacious
sculptor was so struck with the superiority of this natural attitude over
those into which he had been arbitrarily put that he begged him (if
possible) to continue in it for another quarter of an hour, and another
impression was taken off. All three casts remain, and the last is a
proof of the superiority of nature over art. The effect of lassitude is
visible in every part of the frame, and the strong feeling of this
affection, impressed on every limb and muscle, and venting itself
naturally in an involuntary attitude which gave immediate relief, is
that which strikes every one who has seen this fine study from the
life. The casts from this man’s figure have been much admired:—it
is from no superiority of form: it is merely that, being taken from
nature, they bear her ‘image and superscription.’</p>

<p class='c000'>As to expression, the Elgin Marbles (at least the Ilissus and
Theseus) afford no examples, the heads being gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, as to the <em>ideal</em> form, we contend it is nothing but a selection
of fine nature, such as it was seen by the ancient Greek sculptors;
and we say that a sufficient approximation to this form may be found
in our own country, and still more in other countries, at this day, to
warrant the clear conclusion that, under more favourable circumstances
of climate, manners, &amp;c. no vain imagination of the human
mind could come up to entire natural forms; and that actual casts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>from Greek models would rival the common Greek statues, or
surpass them in the same proportion and manner as the Elgin Marbles
do. Or if this conclusion should be doubted, we are ready at any
time to produce at least one cast from living nature, which if it does
not furnish practical proof of all that we have here advanced, we are
willing to forfeit the last thing we can afford to part with—a theory!</p>

<p class='c000'>If then the Elgin Marbles are to be considered as authority in
subjects of art, we conceive the following principles, which have not
hitherto been generally received or acted upon in Great Britain, will
be found to result from them:—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. That art is (first and last) the imitation of nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. That the highest art is the imitation of the finest nature, that is
to say, of that which conveys the strongest sense of pleasure or
power, of the sublime or beautiful.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. That the <em>ideal</em> is only the selecting a particular form which
expresses most completely the idea of a given character or quality, as
of beauty, strength, activity, voluptuousness, &amp;c. and which preserves
that character with the greatest consistency throughout.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. That the <em>historical</em> is nature in action. With regard to the face,
it is expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. That grandeur consists in connecting a number of parts into a
whole, and not in leaving out the parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. That as grandeur is the principle of connexion between different
parts, beauty is the principle of affinity between different forms, or
rather gradual conversion into each other. The one harmonizes, the
other aggrandizes our impressions of things.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. That grace is the beautiful or harmonious in what relates to
position or motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. That grandeur of motion is unity of motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. That strength is the giving the extremes, softness, the uniting them.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. That truth is to a certain degree beauty and grandeur, since all
things are connected, and all things modify one another in nature.
Simplicity is also grand and beautiful for the same reason. Elegance
is ease and lightness, with precision.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this we have, we believe, said before; we shall proceed to such
proofs or explanations as we are able to give of it in another article.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c000'>At the conclusion of a former article on this subject, we ventured
to lay down some general principles, which we shall here proceed to
elucidate in such manner as we are able.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The first was, that <em>art is (first and last) the imitation of nature</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>By nature, we mean actually existing nature, or some one object to
be found <em>in rerum naturâ</em>, not an idea of nature existing solely in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>mind, got from an infinite number of different objects, but which was
never yet embodied in an individual instance. Sir Joshua Reynolds
may be ranked at the head of those who have maintained the supposition
that nature (or the universe of things) was indeed the groundwork
or foundation on which art rested; but that the superstructure
rose above it, that it towered by degrees above the world of realities,
and was suspended in the regions of thought alone—that a middle
form, a more refined idea, borrowed from the observation of a number
of particulars, but unlike any of them, was the standard of truth and
beauty, and the glittering phantom that hovered round the head of the
genuine artist:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>‘So from the ground</div>
      <div class='line'>Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves</div>
      <div class='line'>More airy, last the bright consummate flower!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We have no notion of this vague, equivocal theory of art, and
contend, on the other hand, that each image in art should have a
<em>tally</em> or corresponding prototype in some object in nature. Otherwise,
we do not see the use of art at all: it is a mere superfluity, an
incumbrance to the mind, a piece of ‘laborious foolery’—for the
word, the mere name of any object or class of objects will convey the
general idea, more free from particular details or defects than any the
most neutral and indefinite representation that can be produced by
forms and colours. The word Man, for instance, conveys a more
filmy, impalpable, abstracted, and (according to this hypothesis)
sublime idea of the species, than Michael Angelo’s Adam, or any real
image can possibly do. If this then is the true object of art, the
language of painting, sculpture, &amp;c. becomes quite supererogatory.
Sir Joshua and the rest contend, that nature (properly speaking) does
not express any single individual, nor the whole mass of things as
they exist, but a general principle, a <em>something common</em> to all these,
retaining the perfections, that is, all in which they are alike, and
abstracting the defects, namely, all in which they differ: so that, out
of actual nature, we compound an artificial nature, never answering to
the former in any one part of its mock-existence, and which last is
the true object of imitation to the aspiring artist. Let us adopt this
principle of abstraction as the rule of perfection, and see what havoc
it will make in all our notions and feelings in such matters. If the
<em>perfect</em> is the <em>intermediate</em>, why not confound all objects, all forms, all
colours at once? Instead of painting a landscape with blue sky, or
white clouds, or green earth, or grey rocks and towers; what should
we say if the artist (so named) were to treat all these ‘fair varieties’
as so many imperfections and mistakes in the creation, and mass them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>altogether, by mixing up the colours on his palette in the same dull,
leaden tone, and call this the true principle of epic landscape-painting?
Would not the thing be abominable, an abortion, and worse than the
worst Dutch picture? Variety then is one principle, one beauty in
external nature, and not an everlasting source of pettiness and
deformity, which must be got rid of at all events, before taste can set
its seal upon the work, or fancy own it. But it may be said, it is
different in things of the same species, and particularly in man, who
is cast in a regular mould, which mould is one. What then, are we,
on this pretext, to confound the difference of sex in a sort of hermaphrodite
softness, as Mr. Westall, Angelica Kauffman, and others,
have done in their effeminate performances? Are we to leave out of
the scale of legitimate art, the extremes of infancy and old age, as not
<em>middle terms</em> in man’s life? Are we to strike off from the list of
available topics and sources of interest, the varieties of character, of
passion, of strength, activity, &amp;c.? Is everything to wear the same
form, the same colour, the same unmeaning face? Are we only to
repeat the same average idea of perfection, that is, our own want of
observation and imagination, for ever, and to melt down the
inequalities and excrescences of individual nature in the monotony of
abstraction? Oh no! As well might we prefer the cloud to the
rainbow; the dead corpse to the living moving body! So Sir Joshua
debated upon Rubens’s landscapes, and has a whole chapter to inquire
whether <em>accidents in nature</em>, that is, rainbows, moonlight, sun-sets,
clouds and storms, are the proper thing in the classical style of art.
Again, it is urged that this is not what is meant, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> to exclude
different classes or characters of things, but that there is in each class
or character a <em>middle point</em>, which is the point of perfection. What
middle point? Or how is it ascertained? What is the middle age
of childhood? Or are all children to be alike, dark or fair? Some
of Titian’s children have black hair, and others yellow or auburn:
who can tell which is the most beautiful? May not a St. John be
older than an infant Christ? Must not a Magdalen be different from
a Madonna, a Diana from a Venus? Or may not a Venus have more
or less gravity, a Diana more or less sweetness? What then becomes
of the abstract idea in any of these cases? It varies as it does in
nature; that is, there is indeed a general principle or character to be
adhered to, but modified everlastingly by various other given or
nameless circumstances. The highest art, like nature, is a living
spring of unconstrained excellence, and does not produce a continued
repetition of itself, like plaster-casts from the same figure. But once
more it may be insisted, that in what relates to mere form or organic
structure, there is necessarily a middle line or central point, anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>short of which is deficiency, and anything beyond it excess, being the
average form to which all the other forms included in the same
species tend, and approximate more or less. Then this average form
as it exists in nature should be taken as the model for art. What
occasion to do it out of your own head, when you can bring it under
the cognizance of your senses? Suppose a foot of a certain size and
shape to be the standard of perfection, or if you will, the <em>mean proportion</em>
between all other feet. How can you tell this so well as by
seeing it? How can you copy it so well as by having it actually
before you? But, you will say, there are particular minute defects
in the best-shaped actual foot which ought not to be transferred to the
imitation. Be it so. But are there not also particular minute
beauties in the best, or even the worst shaped actual foot, which you
will only discover by ocular inspection, which are reducible to no
measurement or precepts, and which in finely-developed nature outweigh
the imperfections a thousandfold, the proper general form
being contained there also, and these being only the distinctly articulated
parts of it, with their inflections which no artist can carry in
his head alone? For instance, in the bronze monument of Henry VII.
and his wife, in Westminster Abbey, by the famous Torregiano,
the fingers and fingernails of the woman in particular are made out as
minutely, and, at the same time, as beautifully as it is possible to
conceive; yet they have exactly the effect that a cast taken from a
fine female hand would have, with every natural joint, muscle, and
nerve in complete preservation. Does this take from the beauty or
magnificence of the whole? No: it aggrandises it. What then does
it take from? Nothing but the conceit of the artist that he can paint
a hand out of his own head (that is, out of nothing, and by reducing
it again as near as can be to nothing, to a mere vague image) that
shall be better than any thing in nature. A hand or foot is not <em>one
thing</em>, because it is <em>one word</em> or name; and the painter of mere
abstractions had better lay down his pencil at once, and be contented
to write the descriptions or titles under works of art. Lastly, it may
be objected that a whole figure can never be found perfect or equal;
that the most beautiful arm will not belong to the same figure as the
most beautiful leg, and so on. How is this to be remedied? By
taking the arm from one, and the leg from the other, and clapping
them both on the same body? That will never do; for however
admirable in themselves, they will hardly agree together. One will
have a different character from the other; and they will form a sort
of natural patchwork. Or, to avoid this, will you take neither from
actual models, but derive them from the neutralising medium of your
own imagination. Worse and worse. Copy them from the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>model, the best in all its parts you can get; so that, if you have to
alter, you may alter as little as possible, and retain nearly the whole
substance of nature.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> You may depend upon it that what is so
retained, will alone be of any specific value. The rest may have a
negative merit, but will be positively good for nothing. It will be
to the vital truth and beauty of what is taken from the best nature,
like the piecing of an antique statue. It fills a gap, but nothing
more. It is, in fact, a mental blank.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. This leads us to the second point laid down before, which was,
that <em>the highest art is the imitation of the finest nature, or in other words,
of that which conveys the strongest sense of pleasure or power, of the
sublime or beautiful</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The artist does not pretend to <em>invent</em> an absolutely new class of
objects, without any foundation in nature. He does not spread his
palette on the canvas, for the mere finery of the thing, and tell us
that it makes a brighter show than the rainbow, or even than a bed
of tulips. He does not draw airy forms, moving above the earth,
‘gay creatures of the element, that play i’ th’ plighted clouds,’ and
scorn the mere material existences, the concrete descendants of those
that came out of Noah’s Ark, and that walk, run, or creep upon
it. No, he does not paint only what he has seen <em>in his mind’s eye</em>,
but the common objects that both he and others daily meet—rocks,
clouds, trees, men, women, beasts, fishes, birds, or what he calls
such. He is then an imitator by profession. He gives the
appearances of things that exist outwardly by themselves, and have
a distinct and independent nature of their own. But these know
their own nature best; and it is by consulting them that he can alone
trace it truly, either in the immediate details, or characteristic
essences. Nature is consistent, unaffected, powerful, subtle: art is
forgetful, apish, feeble, coarse. Nature is the original, and therefore
right: art is the copy, and can but tread lamely in the same steps.
Nature penetrates into the parts, and moves the whole mass: it acts
with diversity, and in necessary connexion; for real causes never
forget to operate, and to contribute their portion. Where, therefore,
these causes are called into play to the utmost extent that they ever
go to, there we shall have a strength and a refinement, that art may
imitate but cannot surpass. But it is said that art can surpass this
most perfect image in nature by combining others with it. What!
by joining to the most perfect in its kind something less perfect?
Go to,—this argument will not pass. Suppose you have a goblet of
the finest wine that ever was tasted: you will not mend it by pouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>into it all sorts of samples of an inferior quality. So the best in
nature is the stint and limit of what is best in art: for art can
only borrow from nature still; and, moreover, must borrow entire
objects, for bits only make patches. We defy any landscape-painter
to invent out of his own head, and by jumbling together all
the different forms of hills he ever saw, by adding a bit to one, and
taking a bit from another, anything equal to Arthur’s seat, with the
appendage of Salisbury Crags, that overlook Edinburgh. Why so?
Because there are no levers in the mind of man equal to those with
which nature works at her utmost need. No imagination can toss
and tumble about huge heaps of earth as the ocean in its fury can.
A volcano is more potent to rend rocks asunder than the most
splashing pencil. The convulsions of nature can make a precipice
more frightfully, or heave the backs of mountains more proudly, or
throw their sides into waving lines more gracefully than all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau
idéal</span></i> of art. For there is in nature not only greater power and scope,
but (so to speak) greater knowledge and unity of purpose. Art is
comparatively weak and incongruous, being at once a miniature and
caricature of nature. We grant that a tolerable sketch of Arthur’s
seat, and the adjoining view, is better than Primrose Hill itself, (dear
Primrose Hill! ha! faithless pen, canst thou forget its winding slopes,
and valleys green, to which all Scotland can bring no parallel?) but
no pencil can transform or dandle Primrose Hill (our favourite Primrose
Hill!) into a thing of equal character and sublimity with Arthur’s
seat. It gives us some pain to make this concession; but in doing it,
we flatter ourselves that no Scotchman will have the liberality in any
way to return us the compliment. We do not recollect a more striking
illustration of the difference between art and nature in this respect, than
Mr. Martin’s very singular and, in some things, very meritorious
pictures. But he strives to outdo nature. He wants to give more than
she does, or than his subject requires or admits. He sub-divides his
groups into infinite littleness, and exaggerates his scenery into absolute
immensity. His figures are like rows of shiny pins; his mountains are
piled up one upon the back of the other, like the stories of houses.
He has no notion of the moral principle in all art, that a part may be
greater than the whole. He reckons that if one range of lofty square
hills is good, another range above that with clouds between must be
better. He thus wearies the imagination, instead of exciting it. We
see no end of the journey, and turn back in disgust. We are tired of
the effort, we are tired of the monotony of this sort of reduplication of
the same object. We were satisfied before; but it seems the painter
was not, and we naturally sympathise with him. This craving after
quantity is a morbid affection. A landscape is not an architectural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>elevation. You may build a house as high as you can lift up stones
with pulleys and levers, but you cannot raise mountains into the sky
merely with the pencil. They lose probability and effect by striving
at too much; and, with their ceaseless throes, oppress the imagination
of the spectator, and bury the artist’s fame under them. The only
error of these pictures is, however, that art here puts on her seven-league
boots, and thinks it possible to steal a march upon nature. Mr. Martin
might make Arthur’s Seat sublime, if he chose to take the thing
as it is; but he would be for squaring it according to the mould in
his own imagination, and for clapping another Arthur’s Seat on the
top of it, to make the Calton Hill stare! Again, with respect to
the human figure. This has an internal structure, muscles, bones,
blood-vessels, &amp;c. by means of which the external surface is
operated upon according to certain laws. Does the artist, with all
his generalizations, understand these, as well as nature does? Can he
predict, with all his learning, that if a certain muscle is drawn up in
a particular manner, it will present a particular appearance in a
different part of the arm or leg, or bring out other muscles, which
were before hid, with certain modifications? But in nature all this
is brought about by necessary laws, and the effect is visible to those,
and those only, who look for it in actual objects. This is the great
and master-excellence of the <span class='sc'>Elgin Marbles</span>, that they do not seem
to be the outer surface of a hard and immovable block of marble,
but to be actuated by an internal machinery, and composed of the
same soft and flexible materials as the human body. The skin (or
the outside) seems to be protruded or tightened by the natural action
of a muscle beneath it. This result is miraculous in art: in nature
it is easy and unavoidable. That is to say, art has to imitate or
produce certain effects or appearances without the natural causes:
but the human understanding can hardly be so true to those causes
as the causes to themselves; and hence the necessity (in this sort of
<em>simulated creation</em>) of recurring at every step to the actual objects and
appearances of nature. Having shown so far how indispensable it
is for art to identify itself with nature, in order to preserve the truth
of imitation, without which it is destitute of value or meaning, it may
be said to follow as a necessary consequence, that the only way in
which art can rise to greater dignity or excellence is by finding out
models of greater dignity and excellence in nature. Will any one,
looking at the Theseus, for example, say that it could spring merely
from the artist’s brain, or that it could be done from a common, ill-made,
or stunted body! The fact is, that its superiority consists in
this, that it is a perfect combination of art and nature, or an identical,
and as it were spontaneous copy of an individual picked out of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>finer race of men than generally tread this ball of earth. Could it be
made of a Dutchman’s trunk-hose? No. Could it be made out of
one of Sir Joshua’s Discourses on the <em>middle form</em>? No. How
then? Out of an eye, a head, and a hand, with sense, spirit, and
energy to follow the finest nature, as it appeared exemplified in
sweeping masses, and in subtle details, without pedantry, conceit,
cowardice, or affectation! Some one was asking at Mr. H—yd—n’s
one day, as a few persons were looking at the cast from this figure,
why the original might not have been done as a cast from nature.
Such a supposition would account at least for what seems otherwise
unaccountable—the incredible labour and finishing bestowed on the
back and the other parts of this figure, placed at a prodigious height
against the walls of a temple, where they could never be seen after
they were once put up there. If they were done by means of a cast
in the first instance, the thing appears intelligible, otherwise not. Our
host stoutly resisted this imputation, which tended to deprive art of one
of its greatest triumphs, and to make it as mechanical as a shaded
profile. So far, so good. But the reason he gave was bad, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, that
the limbs could not remain in those actions long enough to be cast.
Yet surely this would take a shorter time than if the model sat to
the sculptor; and we all agreed that nothing but actual, continued,
and intense observation of living nature could give the solidity,
complexity, and refinement of imitation which we saw in the half
animated, almost moving figure before us.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a> Be this as it may, the
principle here stated does not reduce art to the imitation of what is
understood by common or low life. It rises to any point of beauty
or sublimity you please, but it rises only as nature rises exalted with
it too. To hear these critics talk, one would suppose there was
nothing in the world really worth looking at. The Dutch pictures
were the best that they could paint: they had no other landscapes
or faces before them. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Honi soit qui mal y pense.</span></i> Yet who is not
alarmed at a Venus by Rembrandt? The Greek statues were (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum
grano salis</span></i>) Grecian youths and nymphs; and the women in the
streets of Rome (it has been remarked<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a>) look to this hour as if they
had walked out of Raphael’s pictures. Nature is always truth:
at its best, it is beauty and sublimity as well; though Sir Joshua tells
us in one of the papers in the <span class='sc'>Idler</span>, that in itself, or with reference
to individuals, it is a mere tissue of meanness and deformity.
Luckily, the Elgin Marbles say <span class='fss'>NO</span> to that conclusion: for they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>decidedly <em>part and parcel thereof</em>. What constitutes fine nature, we
shall inquire under another head. But we would remark here, that
it can hardly be the <em>middle form</em>, since this principle, however it
might determine certain general proportions and outlines, could never
be intelligible in the details of nature, or applicable to those of art.
Who will say that the form of a finger nail is just midway between
a thousand others that he has <em>not</em> remarked: we are only struck with
it when it is more than ordinarily beautiful, from symmetry, an
oblong shape, &amp;c. The staunch partisans of this theory, however,
get over the difficulty here spoken of, in practice, by omitting the
details altogether, and making their works sketches, or rather what
the French call <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ébauches</span></i> and the English <em>daubs</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <em>The</em> <span class='sc'>Ideal</span> <em>is only the selecting a particular form which expresses
most completely the idea of a given character or quality, as of beauty,
strength, activity, voluptuousness, &amp;c. and which preserves that
character with the greatest consistency throughout</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead of its being true in general that the <em>ideal</em> is the <em>middle point</em>,
it is to be found in the <em>extremes</em>; or, it is carrying any <em>idea</em> as far as
it will go. Thus, for instance, a Silenus is as much an <em>ideal</em> thing as
an Apollo, as to the principle on which it is done, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, giving to
every feature, and to the whole form, the utmost degree of grossness
and sensuality that can be imagined, with this exception (which has
nothing to do with the understanding of the question), that the <em>ideal</em>
means by custom this extreme on the side of the good and beautiful.
With this reserve, the <em>ideal</em> means always the <em>something more</em> of
anything which may be anticipated by the fancy, and which must be
found in nature (by looking long enough for it) to be expressed as
it ought. Suppose a good heavy Dutch face (we speak by the
proverb)—this, you will say, is gross; but it is not gross enough.
You have an idea of something grosser, that is, you have seen
something grosser and must seek for it again. When you meet with
it, and have stamped it on the canvas, or carved it out of the block,
this is the true <em>ideal</em>, namely, that which answers to and satisfies a
preconceived idea; not that which is made out of an abstract idea,
and answers to nothing. In the Silenus, also, according to the
notion we have of the properties and character of that figure, there
must be vivacity, slyness, wantonness, &amp;c. Not only the image in
the mind, but a real face may express all these combined together;
another may express them more, and another most, which last is the
<em>ideal</em>; and when the image in nature coalesces with, and gives a body,
force, and reality to the idea in the mind, then it is that we see the
true perfection of art. The forehead should be ‘villainous low;’
the eye-brows bent in; the eyes small and gloating; the nose <em>pugged</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>and pointed at the end, with distended nostrils; the mouth large and
shut; the cheeks swollen; the neck thick, &amp;c. There is, in all this
process, nothing of softening down, of compromising qualities, of
finding out a <em>mean proportion</em> between different forms and characters;
the sole object is to <em>intensify</em> each as much as possible. The only
fear is ‘to o’erstep the modesty of nature,’ and run into caricature.
This must be avoided; but the artist is only to stop short of this.
He must not outrage probability. We must have seen a class of such
faces, or something so nearly approaching, as to prevent the imagination
from revolting against them. The forehead must be low, but
not so low as to lose the character of humanity in the brute. It
would thus lose all its force and meaning. For that which is
extreme and ideal in one species is nothing, if, by being pushed too
far, it is merged in another. Above all, there should be <em>keeping</em> in
the whole and every part. In the Pan, the horns and goat’s feet,
perhaps, warrant the approach to a more <em>animal</em> expression than
would otherwise be allowable in the human features; but yet this
tendency to excess must be restrained within certain limits. If Pan
is made into a beast, he will cease to be a God! Let Momus distend
his jaws with laughter, as far as laughter can stretch them, but no
farther; or the expression will be that of pain and not of pleasure.
Besides, the overcharging the expression or action of any one feature
will suspend the action of others. The whole face will no longer
laugh. But this universal suffusion of broad mirth and humour over
the countenance is very different from a placid smile, midway
between grief and joy. Yet a classical Momus, by modern theories
of the <em>ideal</em>, ought to be such a nonentity in expression. The
ancients knew better. They pushed art in such subjects to the
verge of ‘all we hate,’ while they felt the point beyond which it
could not be urged with propriety, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> with truth, consistency, and
consequent effect. There is no difference, in philosophical reasoning,
between the mode of art here insisted on, and the <em>ideal</em> regularity of
such figures as the Apollo, the Hercules, the Mercury, the Venus,
&amp;c. All these are, as it were, <em>personifications</em>, <em>essences</em>, <em>abstractions</em>
of certain qualities of virtue in human nature, not of human nature in
general, which would make nonsense. Instead of being abstractions
of all sorts of qualities jumbled together in a neutral character, they
are in the opposite sense <em>abstractions</em> of some single quality or
customary combination of qualities, leaving out all others as much as
possible, and imbuing every part with that one predominant character
to the utmost. The Apollo is a representation of graceful dignity
and mental power; the Hercules of bodily strength; the Mercury of
swiftness; the Venus of female loveliness, and so on. In these, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the Apollo is surely implied and found more grace than usual;
in the Hercules more strength than usual; in the Mercury more
lightness than usual; in the Venus more softness than usual. Is it
not so? What then becomes of the pretended <em>middle form</em>? One
would think it would be sufficient to prove this, to ask, ‘Do not these
statues differ from one another? And is this difference a defect?’
It would be ridiculous to call them by different names, if they were
not supposed to represent different and peculiar characters: sculptors
should, in that case, never carve anything but the statue of <em>a man</em>,
the statue of <em>a woman</em>, &amp;c. and this would be the name of perfection.
This theory of art is not at any rate justified by the history of
art. An extraordinary quantity of bone and muscle is as proper to
the Hercules as his club, and it would be strange if the Goddess
of Love had not a more delicately rounded form, and a more
languishing look withal, than the Goddess of Hunting. That
a form combining and blending the properties of both, the downy
softness of the one, with the elastic buoyancy of the other, would
be more perfect than either, we no more see than that grey is
the most perfect of colours. At any rate, this is the march neither
of nature nor of art. It is not denied that these antique sculptures are
models of the <em>ideal</em>; nay, it is on them that this theory boasts of being
founded. Yet they give a flat contradiction to its insipid mediocrity.
Perhaps some of them have a slight bias to the false <em>ideal</em>, to the
smooth and uniform, or the negation of nature: any error on this side
is, however, happily set right by the <span class='sc'>Elgin Marbles</span>, which are the
paragons of sculpture and the mould of form.—As the <em>ideal</em> then requires
a difference of character in each figure as a whole, so it expects
the same character (or a corresponding one) to be stamped on each
part of every figure. As the legs of a Diana should be more muscular
and adapted for running, than those of a Venus or a Minerva, so the
skin of her face ought to be more tense, bent on her prey, and
hardened by being exposed to the winds of heaven. The respective
characters of lightness, softness, strength, &amp;c. should pervade each
part of the surface of each figure, but still varying according to the
texture and functions of the individual part. This can only be
learned or practised from the attentive observation of nature in those
forms in which any given character or excellence is most strikingly
displayed, and which has been selected for imitation and study on that
account.—Suppose a dimple in the chin to be a mark of voluptuousness;
then the Venus should have a dimple in the chin; and she has
one. But this will imply certain correspondent indications in other
parts of the features, about the corners of the mouth, a gentle
undulation and sinking in of the cheek, as if it had just been pinched,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>and so on: yet so as to be consistent with the other qualities of
roundness, smoothness, &amp;c. which belong to the idea of the character.
Who will get all this and embody it out of the idea of a <em>middle form</em>,
I cannot say: it may be, and has been, got out of the idea of a
number of distinct enchanting graces in the mind, and from some
heavenly object unfolded to the sight!</p>

<p class='c000'>4. <em>That the historical is nature in action. With regard to the face, it
is expression.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>Hogarth’s pictures are true history. Every feature, limb, figure,
group, is instinct with life and motion. He does not take a subject and
place it in a position, like a lay figure, in which it stirs neither limb nor
joint. The scene moves before you: the face is like a frame-work of
flexible machinery. If the mouth is distorted with laughter, the eyes
swim in laughter. If the forehead is knit together, the cheeks are
puckered up. If a fellow squints most horribly, the rest of his face is
awry. The muscles pull different ways, or the same way, at the same
time, on the surface of the picture, as they do in the human body. What
you see is the reverse of <em>still life</em>. There is a continual and complete
action and re-action of one variable part upon another, as there is
in the <span class='sc'>Elgin Marbles</span>. If you pull the string of a bow, the bow
itself is bent. So is it in the strings and wires that move the human
frame. The action of any one part, the contraction or relaxation of
any one muscle, extends more or less perceptibly to every other:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Thrills in each nerve, and lives along the line.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Thus the celebrated Iö of Correggio is imbued, steeped, in a manner in
the same voluptuous feeling all over—the same passion languishes in her
whole frame, and communicates the infection to the feet, the back,
and the reclined position of the head. This is history, not carpenter’s
work. Some painters fancy that they paint history, if they get the
measurement from the foot to the knee and put four bones where
there are four bones. This is not our idea of it; but we think it is
to show how one part of the body sways another in action and in
passion. The last relates chiefly to the expression of the face, though
not altogether. Passion may be shown in a clenched fist as well as
in clenched teeth. The face, however, is the throne of expression.
Character implies the feeling, which is fixed and permanent; expression
that which it occasional and momentary, at least, technically
speaking. Portrait treats of objects as they are; history of the events
and changes to which they are liable. And so far history has a
double superiority; or a double difficulty to overcome, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> in the
rapid glance over a number of parts subject to the simultaneous action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>of the same law, and in the scope of feeling required to sympathise
with the critical and powerful movements of passion. It requires
greater capacity of muscular motion to follow the progress of a
carriage in violent motion, than to lean upon it standing still. If, to
describe passion, it were merely necessary to observe its outward effects,
these, perhaps, in the prominent points, become more visible and more
tangible as the passion is more intense. But it is not only necessary
to see the effects, but to discern the cause, in order to make the one
true to the other. No painter gives more of intellectual or impassioned
appearances than he understands or feels. It is an axiom in painting
that sympathy is indispensable to truth of expression. Without it, you
get only caricatures, which are not the thing. But to sympathise
with passion, a greater fund of sensibility is demanded in proportion to
the strength or tenderness of the passion. And as he feels most of
this whose face expresses most passion, so he also feels most by
sympathy whose hand can describe most passion. This amounts
nearly, we take it, to a demonstration of an old and very disputed
point. The same reasoning might be applied to poetry, but this is not
the place.—Again, it is easier to paint a portrait than an historical
face, because the head <em>sits</em> for the first, but the expression will hardly
<em>sit</em> for the last. Perhaps those passions are the best subjects for
painting, the expression of which may be retained for some time, so as
to be better caught, which throw out a sort of lambent fire, and leave
a reflected glory behind them, as we see in Madonnas, Christ’s heads,
and what is understood by sacred subjects in general. The violences
of human passion are too soon over to be copied by the hand, and the
mere conception of the internal workings is not here sufficient, as it
is in poetry. A portrait is to history what still-life is to portraiture:
that is, the whole remains the same while you are doing it; or while
you are occupied about each part, the rest wait for you. Yet, what
a difference is there between taking an original portrait and making a
copy of one! This shows that the face in its most ordinary state is
continually varying and in action. So much of history is there in
portrait!—No one should pronounce definitively on the superiority of
history over portrait, without recollecting Titian’s heads. The finest
of them are very nearly (say quite) equal to the finest of Raphael’s.
They have almost the look of <em>still-life</em>, yet each part is decidedly
influenced by the rest. Everything is <em>relative</em> in them. You cannot
put any other eye, nose, lip in the same face. As is one part, so is
the rest. You cannot fix on any particular beauty; the charm is in
the whole. They have least action, and the most expression of any
portraits. They are doing nothing, and yet all other business seems
insipid in comparison of their thoughts. They are silent, retired, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>do not court observation; yet you cannot keep your eyes from them.
Some one said, that you would be as cautious of your behaviour in a
room where a picture of Titian’s was hung, as if there was somebody
by—so entirely do they look you through. They are the least tiresome
<em>furniture-company</em> in the world!</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <em>Grandeur consists in connecting a number of parts into a whole, and
not leaving out the parts.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Joshua lays it down that the great style in art consists in the
omission of the details. A greater error never man committed. The
great style consists in preserving the masses and general proportions;
not in omitting the details. Thus, suppose, for illustration’s sake, the
general form of an eye-brow to be commanding and grand. It is of
a certain size, and arched in a particular curve. Now, surely, this
general form or outline will be equally preserved, whether the painter
daubs it in, in a bold, rough way, as Reynolds or perhaps Rembrandt
would, or produces the effect by a number of hair-lines arranged in
the same form as Titian sometimes did; and in his best pictures. It
will not be denied (for it cannot) that the characteristic form of the
eye-brow would be the same, or that the effect of the picture at a
small distance would be nearly the same in either case; only in the
latter, it would be rather more perfect, as being more like nature.
Suppose a strong light to fall on one side of a face, and a deep shadow
to involve the whole of the other. This would produce two distinct
and large masses in the picture; which answers to the conditions of
what is called the grand style of composition. Well, would it destroy
these masses to give the smallest veins or variation of colour or surface
in the light side, or to shade the other with the most delicate and
elaborate <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-scuro</span></i>? It is evident not; from common sense, from
the practice of the best masters, and, lastly, from the example of
nature, which contains both the larger masses, the strongest contrasts,
and the highest finishing, within itself. The integrity of the whole,
then, is not impaired by the indefinite subdivision and smallness of
the parts. The grandeur of the ultimate effects depends entirely on
the arrangement of these in a certain form or under certain masses.
The Ilissus, or River-god, is floating in his proper element, and is,
in appearance, as firm as a rock, as pliable as a wave of the sea. The
artist’s breath might be said to mould and play upon the undulating
surface. The whole is expanded into noble proportions, and heaves
with general effect. What then? Are the parts unfinished; or are
they not there? No; they are there with the nicest exactness,
but in due subordination; that is, they are there as they are found in
fine nature; and float upon the general form, like straw or weeds upon
the tide of ocean. Once more: in Titian’s portraits we perceive a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>certain character stamped upon the different features. In the Hippolito
de Medici the eye-brows are angular, the nose is peaked, the
mouth has sharp corners, the face is (so to speak) a pointed oval.
The drawing in each of these is as careful and distinct as can be.
But the unity of intention in nature, and in the artist, does not the less
tend to produce a general grandeur and impressiveness of effect;
which at first sight it is not easy to account for. To combine a
number of particulars to one end is not to omit them altogether; and
is the best way of producing the grand style, because it does this
without either affectation or slovenliness.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The sixth rule we proposed to lay down was, that <em>as grandeur
is the principle of connexion between different parts; beauty is the principle
of affinity between different forms, or their gradual conversion into each
other. The one harmonizes, the other aggrandizes, our impressions of things.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>There is a harmony of colours and a harmony of sounds, unquestionably:
why then there should be all this squeamishness about
admitting an original harmony of forms as the principle of beauty and
source of pleasure there we cannot understand. It is true, that there
is in organized bodies a certain standard of form to which they
approximate more or less, and from which they cannot very widely
deviate without shocking the sense of custom, or our settled expectations
of what they ought to be. And hence it has been pretended
that there is in all such cases a <em>middle central form</em>, obtained by leaving
out the peculiarities of all the others, which alone is the pure standard
of truth and beauty. A conformity to custom is, we grant, one
condition of beauty or source of satisfaction to the eye, because an
abrupt transition shocks; but there is a conformity (or correspondence)
of colours, sounds, lines, among themselves, which is soft and
pleasing for the same reason. The average or customary form merely
determines what is <em>natural</em>. A thing cannot please, unless it is to be
found in nature; but that which is natural is most pleasing, according
as it has other properties which in themselves please. Thus the
colour of a cheek must be the natural complexion of a human face;—it
would not do to make it the colour of a flower or a precious stone;—but
among complexions ordinarily to be found in nature, that is most
beautiful which would be thought so abstractedly, or in itself. Yellow
hair is not the most common, nor is it a <em>mean proportion</em> between the
different colours of women’s hair. Yet, who will say that it is not
the most beautiful? Blue or green hair would be a defect and an
anomaly, not because it is not the <em>medium</em> of nature, but because it is
not in nature at all. To say that there is no difference in the sense
of form except from custom, is like saying that there is no difference
in the sensation of smooth or rough. Judging by analogy, a gradation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>or symmetry of form must affect the mind in the same manner as a
gradation of recurrence at given intervals of tones or sounds; and if
it does so in fact, we need not inquire further for the principle. Sir
Joshua (who is the arch-heretic on this subject) makes grandeur or
sublimity consist in the middle form, or abstraction of all peculiarities;
which is evidently false, for grandeur and sublimity arise from extraordinary
strength, magnitude, &amp;c. or in a word, from an excess of
power, so as to startle and overawe the mind. But as sublimity is an
excess of power, beauty is, we conceive, the blending and harmonizing
different powers or qualities together, so as to produce a soft and
pleasurable sensation. That it is not the middle form of the species
seems proved in various ways. First, because one species is more
beautiful than another, according to common sense. A rose is the
queen of flowers, in poetry at least; but in this philosophy any other
flower is as good. A swan is more beautiful than a goose; a stag
than a goat. Yet if custom were the test of beauty, either we should
give no preference, or our preference would be reversed. Again, let
us go back to the human face and figure. A straight nose is allowed
to be handsome, that is, one that presents nearly a continuation of the
line of the forehead, and the sides of which are nearly parallel. Now
this cannot be the mean proportion of the form of noses. For, first,
most noses are broader at the bottom than at the top, inclining to
the negro head, but none are broader at top than at the bottom, to
produce the Greek form as a balance between both. Almost all
noses sink in immediately under the forehead bone, none ever project
there; so that the nearly straight line continued from the forehead
cannot be a mean proportion struck between the two extremes of
convex and concave form in this feature of the face. There must,
therefore, be some other principle of symmetry, continuity, &amp;c. to
account for the variation from the prescribed rule. Once more (not
to multiply instances tediously), a double calf is undoubtedly the
perfection of beauty in the form of the leg. But this is a rare thing.
Nor is it the medium between two common extremes. For the
muscles seldom swell enough to produce this excrescence, if it may be
so called, and never run to an excess there, so as, by diminishing the
quantity, to subside into proportion and beauty. But this second or
lower calf is a connecting link between the upper calf and the small
of the leg, and is just like a second chord or half-note in music. We
conceive that any one who does not perceive the beauty of the Venus
de Medicis, for instance, in this respect, has not the proper perception
of form in his mind. As this is the most disputable, or at least the
most disputed part of our theory, we may, perhaps, have to recur to
it again, and shall leave an opening for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>7. <em>That grace is the beautiful or harmonious in what relates to
position or motion.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>There needs not much be said on this point; as we apprehend it
will be granted that, whatever beauty is as to the form, grace is the
same thing in relation to the use that is made of it. Grace, in writing,
relates to the transitions that are made from one subject to another,
or to the movement that is given to a passage. If one thing leads to
another, or an idea or illustration is brought in without effect, or
without making a <em>boggle</em> in the mind, we call this a graceful style.
Transitions must in general be gradual and pieced together. But
sometimes the most violent are the most graceful, when the mind is
fairly tired out and exhausted with a subject, and is glad to leap to
another as a repose and relief from the first. Of these there are
frequent instances in Mr. Burke’s writings, which have something
Pindaric in them. That which is not beautiful in itself, or in the
mere form, may be made so by position or motion. A figure by no
means elegant may be put in an elegant position. Mr. Kean’s figure
is not good; yet we have seen him throw himself into attitudes of
infinite spirit, dignity, and grace. John Kemble’s figure, on the
contrary, is fine in itself; and he has only to show himself to be
admired. The direction in which anything is moved has evidently
nothing to do with the shape of the thing moved. The one may be
a circle and the other a square. Little and deformed people seem to
be well aware of this distinction, who, in spite of their unpromising
appearance, usually assume the most imposing attitudes, and give themselves
the most extraordinary airs imaginable.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. <em>Grandeur of motion is unity of motion.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>This principle hardly needs illustration. Awkwardness is contradictory
or disjointed motion.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. <em>Strength in art is giving the extremes, softness the uniting
them.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>There is no incompatibility between strength and softness, as is
sometimes supposed by frivolous people. Weakness is not refinement.
A shadow may be twice as deep in a finely coloured picture as in
another, and yet almost imperceptible, from the gradations that lead
to it, and blend it with the light. Correggio had prodigious strength,
and greater softness. Nature is strong and soft, beyond the reach of
art to imitate. Softness then does not imply the absence of considerable
extremes, but it is the interposing a third thing between them,
to break the force of the contrast. Guido is more soft than strong.
Rembrandt is more strong than soft.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. And lastly. <em>That truth is, to a certain degree, beauty and
grandeur, since all things are connected, and all things modify one another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>in nature. Simplicity is also grand and beautiful for the same reason.
Elegance is ease and lightness, with precision.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>This last head appears to contain a number of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratis dicta</span></i>, got
together for the sake of completing a decade of propositions. They
have, however, some show of truth, and we should add little clearness
to them by any reasoning upon the matter. So we will conclude
here for the present.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old sarcasm—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne ignotum pro magnifico est</span></i>—cannot be justly
applied here. <span class='sc'>Fonthill Abbey</span>, after being enveloped in impenetrable
mystery for a length of years, has been unexpectedly thrown
open to the vulgar gaze, and has lost none of its reputation for
magnificence—though, perhaps, its visionary glory, its classic renown,
have vanished from the public mind for ever. It is, in a word, a
desert of magnificence, a glittering waste of laborious idleness, a
cathedral turned into a toy-shop, an immense Museum of all that
is most curious and costly, and, at the same time, most worthless,
in the productions of art and nature. Ships of pearl and seas of
amber are scarce a fable here—a nautilus’s shell surmounted with a
gilt triumph of Neptune—tables of agate, cabinets of ebony and
precious stones, painted windows ‘shedding a gaudy, crimson light,’
satin borders, marble floors, and lamps of solid gold—Chinese
pagodas and Persian tapestry—all the miniature splendour of Solomon’s
Temple is displayed to the view—whatever is far-fetched and dear-bought,
rich in the materials, or rare and difficult in the workmanship—but
scarce one genuine work of art, one solid proof of taste, one
lofty relic of sentiment or imagination!</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficult, the unattainable, the exclusive, are to be found here
in profusion, in perfection; all else is wanting, or is brought in
merely as a foil or as a stop-gap. In this respect the collection is
as satisfactory as it is <em>unique</em>. The specimens exhibited are the best,
the most highly finished, the most costly and curious, of that kind
of ostentatious magnificence which is calculated to gratify the sense
of property in the owner, and to excite the wondering curiosity of
the stranger, who is permitted to see or (as a choice privilege and
favour) even to touch baubles so dazzling and of such exquisite
nicety of execution; and which, if broken or defaced, it would be
next to impossible to replace. The same character extends to the
pictures, which are mere furniture-pictures, remarkable chiefly for
their antiquity or painful finishing, without beauty, without interest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and with about the same pretensions to attract the eye or delight the
fancy as a well-polished mahogany table or a waxed oak-floor. Not
one great work by one great name, scarce one or two of the worst
specimens of the first masters, Leonardo’s Laughing Boy, or a copy
from Raphael or Correggio, as if to make the thing remote and finical—but
heaps of the most elaborate pieces of the worst of the Dutch
masters, Breughel’s Sea-horses with coats of mother-of-pearl, and
Rottenhammer’s Elements turned into a Flower-piece. The Catalogue,
in short, is guiltless of the names of any of those works of art</p>

spread out upon the walls! What a spirit of poetry and philosophy
might breathe there! What a solemn gloom, what gay vistas of
fancy, like chequered light and shade, might genius, guided by art,
shed around! The author of Vathek is a scholar; the proprietor
of Fonthill has travelled abroad, and has seen all the finest remains
of antiquity and boasted specimens of modern art. Why not lay his
hands on some of these? He had power to carry them away. One
might have expected to see, at least, a few fine old pictures, marble
copies of the celebrated statues, the Apollo, the Venus, the Dying
Gladiator, the Antinous, antique vases with their elegant sculptures,
or casts from them, coins, medals, bas-reliefs, something connected
with the beautiful forms of external nature, or with what is great in
the mind or memorable in the history of man,—Egyptian hieroglyphics,
or Chaldee manuscripts, or paper made of the reeds of the
Nile, or mummies from the Pyramids! Not so; not a trace (or
scarcely so) of any of these;—as little as may be of what is classical
or imposing to the imagination from association or well-founded
prejudice; hardly an article of any consequence that does not seem
to be labelled to the following effect—‘<em>This is mine, and there is no one
else in the whole world in whom it can inspire the least interest, or any
feeling beyond a momentary surprise!</em>’ To show another <em>your</em> property
is an act in itself ungracious, or null and void. It excites no pleasure
from sympathy. Every one must have remarked the difference in
his feelings on entering a venerable old cathedral, for instance, and a
modern-built private mansion. The one seems to fill the mind and
expand the form, while the other only produces a sense of listless
vacuity, and disposes us to shrink into our own littleness. Whence
is this, but that in the first case our associations of power, of interest,
are general, and tend to aggrandize the species; and that in the
latter (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> the case of private property) they are exclusive, and tend
to aggrandize none but the individual? This must be the effect,
unless there is something grand or beautiful in the objects themselves
that makes us forget the distinction of mere property, as from the
noble architecture or great antiquity of a building; or unless they
remind us of common and universal nature, as pictures, statues do,
like so many mirrors, reflecting the external landscape, and carrying
us out of the magic circle of self-love. But all works of art come
under the head of property or showy furniture, which are neither
distinguished by sublimity nor beauty, and are estimated only by the
labour required to produce what is trifling or worthless, and are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>consequently nothing more than obtrusive proofs of the wealth of the
immediate possessor. The motive for the production of such toys is
mercenary, and the admiration of them childish or servile. That
which pleases merely from its novelty, or because it was never seen
before, cannot be expected to please twice: that which is remarkable
for the difficulty or costliness of the execution can be interesting to
no one but the maker or owner. A shell, however rarely to be met
with, however highly wrought or quaintly embellished, can only
flatter the sense of curiosity for a moment in a number of persons,
or the feeling of vanity for a greater length of time in a single person.
There are better things than this (we will be bold to say) in the
world both of nature and art—things of universal and lasting interest,
things that appeal to the imagination and the affections. The village-bell
that rings out its sad or merry tidings to old men and maidens, to
children and matrons, goes to the heart, because it is a sound significant
of weal or woe to all, and has borne no uninteresting intelligence to
you, to me, and to thousands more who have heard it perhaps for
centuries. There is a sentiment in it. The face of a Madonna (if
equal to the subject) has also a sentiment in it, ‘whose price is above
rubies.’ It is a shrine, a consecrated source of high and pure feeling,
a well-head of lovely expression, at which the soul drinks and is
refreshed, age after age. The mind converses with the mind, or
with that nature which, from long and daily intimacy, has become a
sort of second self to it: but what sentiment lies hid in a piece of
porcelain? What soul can you look for in a gilded cabinet or a
marble slab? Is it possible there can be any thing like a feeling of
littleness or jealousy in this proneness to a merely ornamental taste,
that, from not sympathising with the higher and more expansive
emanations of thought, shrinks from their display with conscious
weakness and inferiority? If it were an apprehension of an invidious
comparison between the proprietor and the author of any signal work
of genius, which the former did not covet, one would think he must
be at least equally mortified at sinking to a level in taste and pursuits
with the maker of a Dutch toy. Mr. Beckford, however, has
always had the credit of the highest taste in works of art as well as
in <em>virtù</em>. As the showman in Goldsmith’s comedy declares that
‘his bear dances to none but the genteelest of tunes—<cite>Water parted
from the Sea</cite>, or <cite>The Minuet in Ariadne</cite>;’—so it was supposed that this
celebrated collector’s money went for none but the finest Claudes and
the choicest specimens of some rare Italian master. The two Claudes
are gone. It is as well—they must have felt a little out of their place
here—they are kept in countenance, where they are, by the very
best company!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>We once happened to have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Beckford
in the Great Gallery of the Louvre—he was very plainly dressed in
a loose great coat, and looked somewhat pale and thin—but what
brought the circumstance to our minds, was that we were told on this
occasion one of those thumping matter-of-fact lies, which are pretty
common to other Frenchmen besides Gascons—viz. <em>That he had
offered the First Consul no less a sum than two hundred thousand guineas
for the purchase of the St. Peter Martyr</em>. Would that he had! and
that Napoleon had taken him at his word!—which we think not
unlikely. With two hundred thousand guineas he might have taken
some almost impregnable fortress. ‘Magdeburg,’ said Buonaparte,
‘is worth a hundred queens:’ and he would have thought such
another stronghold worth at least one Saint. As it is, what an
opportunity have we lost of giving the public an account of this
picture! Yet why not describe it, as we see it still ‘in our mind’s
eye,’ standing on the floor of the Thuilleries, with none of its brightness
impaired, through the long perspective of waning years? There it
stands, and will for ever stand in our imagination, with the dark,
scowling, terrific face of the murdered monk looking up to his
assassin, the horror-struck features of the flying priest, and the skirts
of his vest waving in the wind, the shattered branches of the autumnal
trees that feel the coming gale, with that cold convent spire rising
in the distance amidst the sapphire hills and golden sky—and over-head
are seen the cherubim bringing the crown of martyrdom with
rosy fingers; and (such is the feeling of truth, the soul of faith in the
picture) you hear floating near, in dim harmonies, the pealing anthem,
and the heavenly choir! Surely, the St. Peter Martyr surpasses all
Titian’s other works, as he himself did all other painters. Had this
picture been transferred to the present collection (or any picture like
it) what a trail of glory would it have left behind it! for what a
length of way would it have haunted the imagination! how often
should we have wished to revisit it, and how fondly would the eye
have turned back to the stately tower of Fonthill Abbey, that from
the western horizon gives the setting sun to other climes, as the
beacon and guide to the knowledge and the love of high Art!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke of Wellington, it is said, has declared Fonthill to be
‘the finest thing in Europe.’ If so, it is since the dispersion of the
Louvre. It is also said, that the King is to visit it. We do not
mean to say it is not a fit place for the King to visit, or for the Duke
to praise: but we know this, that it is a very bad one for us to
describe. The father of Mr. Christie was supposed to be ‘equally
great on a ribbon or a Raphael.’ This is unfortunately not our
case. We are not ‘great’ at all, but least of all in little things.

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Shall we go on with this fooling? We cannot. The reader
must be tired of such an uninteresting account of empty jars and
caskets—it reads so like Della Cruscan poetry. They are not even
<em>Nugæ Canoræ</em>. The pictures are much in the same <em>mimminèe-pimminèe</em>
taste. For instance, in the first and second days’ sale we meet with
the following:—</p>

<p class='c016'>A high-finished miniature drawing of a Holy Family, and a portrait: one
of those with which the patents of the Venetian nobility were usually
embellished.</p>

<p class='c016'>A small landscape, by Breughel.</p>

<p class='c016'>A small miniature painting after Titian, by Stella.</p>

<p class='c016'>A curious painting, by Peter Peters Breughel, the conflagration of Troy—a
choice specimen of this scarce master.</p>

<p class='c016'>A picture by Franks, representing the temptation of St. Anthony.</p>

<p class='c016'>A picture by old Breughel, representing a fête—a singular specimen of
his first manner.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lucas Cranach—The Madonna and Child—highly finished.</p>

<p class='c016'>A crucifixion, painted upon a gold ground, by Andrea Orcagna, a rare and
early specimen of Italian art. From the Campo Santo di Pisa.</p>

<p class='c016'>A lady’s portrait, by Cosway.</p>

<p class='c016'>Netecher—a lady seated, playing on the harpsichord, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who cares any thing about such frippery, time out of mind the
stale ornaments of a pawnbroker’s shop; or about old Breughel, or
Stella, or Franks, or Lucas Cranach, or Netecher, or Cosway?—But
at that last name we pause, and must be excused if we consecrate
to him a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit souvenir</span></i> in our best manner: for he was Fancy’s child.
All other collectors are fools to him: they go about with painful
anxiety to find out the realities:—he <em>said</em> he had them—and in
a moment made them of the breath of his nostrils and the fumes
of a lively imagination. His was the crucifix that Abelard prayed
to—the original manuscript of the Rape of the Lock—the dagger
with which Felton stabbed the Duke of Buckingham—the first
finished sketch of the Jocunda—Titian’s large colossal portrait of
Peter Aretine—a mummy of an Egyptian king—an alligator stuffed.
Were the articles authentic?—no matter—his faith in them was true.
What a fairy palace was his of specimens of art, antiquarianism,
and <em>virtù</em>, jumbled all together in the richest disorder, dusty,
shadowy, obscure, with much left to the imagination (how different
from the finical, polished, petty, perfect, modernised air of Fonthill!)
and with copies of the old masters, cracked and damaged, which he
touched and retouched with his own hand, and yet swore they were
the genuine, the pure originals! He was gifted with a <em>second-sight</em>
in such matters: he believed whatever was incredible. Happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>mortal! Fancy bore sway in him, and so vivid were his impressions
that they included the reality in them. The agreeable and the true
with him were one. He believed in Swedenborgianism—he
believed in animal magnetism—he had conversed with more than
one person of the Trinity—he could talk with his lady at Mantua
through some fine vehicle of sense, as we speak to a servant down
stairs through an ear-pipe.—Richard Cosway was not the man to
flinch from an <em>ideal</em> proposition. Once, at an Academy dinner,
when some question was made, whether the story of Lambert’s leap
was true, he started up, and said it was, for he was the man that
performed it;—he once assured us, that the knee-pan of King James <span class='fss'>I.</span>
at Whitehall was nine feet across (he had measured it in concert
with Mr. Cipriani); he could read in the book of Revelations
without spectacles, and foretold the return of Buonaparte from Elba
and from St. Helena. His wife, the most lady-like of Englishwomen,
being asked, in Paris, what sort of a man her husband was,
answered, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours riant, toujours gai</span></i>. This was true. He must
have been of French extraction. His soul had the life of a bird;
and such was the jauntiness of his air and manner that, to see him
sit to have his half-boots laced on, you would fancy (with the help
of a figure) that, instead of a little withered elderly gentleman, it was
Venus attired by the Graces. His miniatures were not fashionable—they
were fashion itself. When more than ninety, he retired from
his profession, and used to hold up the palsied right hand that had
painted lords and ladies for upwards of sixty years, and smiled, with
unabated good humour, at the vanity of human wishes. Take him
with all his faults or follies, ‘we scarce shall look upon his like again!’</p>

<p class='c000'>After speaking of him, we are ashamed to go back to Fonthill,
lest one drop of gall should fall from our pen. No, for the rest of
our way, we will dip it in the milk of human kindness, and deliver
all with charity. There are four or five very curious cabinets—a
triple jewel cabinet of opaque, with panels of transparent amber,
dazzles the eye like a temple of the New Jerusalem—the Nautilus’s
shell, with the triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite, is elegant, and
the table on which it stands superb—the cups, vases, and sculptures,
by Cellini, Berg, and John of Bologna, are as admirable as they are
rare—the Berghem (a sea-port) is a fair specimen of that master—the
Poulterer’s Shop, by G. Douw, is passable—there are some
middling Bassans—the Sibylla Libyca, of L. Caracci, is in the
grand style of composition—there is a good copy of a head by
Parmegiano—the painted windows in the centre of the Abbey have
a surprising effect—the form of the building (which was raised by
torch-light) is fantastical, to say the least—and the grounds, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>are extensive and fine from situation, are laid out with the hand of a
master. A quantity of coot, teal, and wild fowl sport in a crystal
stream that winds along the park; and their dark brown coats, seen
in the green shadows of the water, have a most picturesque effect.
Upon the whole, if we were not much pleased by our excursion to
Fonthill, we were very little disappointed; and the place altogether
is consistent and characteristic.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>JUDGING OF PICTURES</h3>

<p class='c008'>Painters assume that none can judge of pictures but themselves.
Many do this avowedly, some by implication, and all in practice.
They exclaim against any one writing about art who has not served
his apprenticeship to the craft, who is not versed in the detail of its
mechanism. This has often put me a little out of patience—but I
will take patience, and say why.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first place, with regard to the productions of living artists,
painters have no right to speak at all. The way in which they are
devoured and consumed by envy would be ludicrous if it were not
lamentable. It is folly to talk of the divisions and backbitings of
authors and poets while there are such people as painters in the
world. I never in the whole course of my life heard one speak in
hearty praise of another. Generally they blame downrightly—but
at all events their utmost applause is with a damning reservation.
Authors—even poets, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus irritabile</span></i>—do taste and acknowledge
the beauties of the productions of their competitors; but painters
either cannot see them through the green spectacles of envy, or
seeing, they hate and deny them the more. In conformity with
this, painters are more greedy of praise than any other order of men.
‘They gorge the little fame they get all raw’—they are gluttonous
of it in their own persons in the proportion in which they would
starve others.</p>

<p class='c000'>I once knew a very remarkable instance of this. A friend of mine
had written a criticism of an exhibition. In this were mentioned in
terms of the highest praise the works of two brothers—sufficiently
so, indeed, to have satisfied, one would have thought, the most
insatiate. I was going down into the country to the place where
these brothers lived, and I was asked to be the bearer of the work
in which the critique appeared. I was so, and sent a copy to each
of them. Some days afterwards I called on one of them, who
began to speak of the review of his pictures. He expressed some
thanks for what was said of them, but complained that the writer of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>it had fallen into a very common error under which he had often
suffered—the confounding, namely, his pictures with his brother’s.
‘Now, my dear sir,’ continued he, ‘what is said of me is all very
well, but here,’ turning to the high-wrought panegyric on his brother,
‘this is all in allusion to my style—this is all with reference to my
pictures—this is all meant for me.’ I could hardly help exclaiming
before the man’s face. The praise which was given to himself was
such as would have called a blush to any but a painter’s face to speak
of; but, not content with this, he insisted on appropriating his
brother’s also: How insatiate is the pictorial man!</p>

<p class='c000'>But to come to the more general subject—I deny <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in toto</span></i> and at
once the exclusive right and power of painters to judge of pictures.
What is a picture meant for? To convey certain ideas to the mind
of painters? that is, of one man in ten thousand?—No, but to make
them apparent to the eye and mind of all. If a picture be admired
by none but painters, I think it is strong presumption that the
picture is bad. A painter is no more a judge, I suppose, than
another man of how people feel and look under certain passions and
events. Every body sees as well as him whether certain figures on
the canvas are like such a man, or like a cow, a tree, a bridge, or a
windmill. All that the painter can do more than the <em>lay</em> spectator,
is to tell <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> the merits and defects of a picture are produced.
I see that such a figure is ungraceful and out of nature—he
shows me that the drawing is faulty, or the foreshortening incorrect.
He then points out to me whence the blemish arises; but he is not
a bit more aware of the existence of the blemish than I am. In
Hogarth’s ‘Frontispiece’ I see that the whole business is absurd,
for a man on a hill two miles off could not light his pipe at a candle
held out of a window close to me—he tells me that it is from a want
of perspective, that is, of certain rules by which certain effects are
obtained. He shows me <em>why</em> the picture is bad, but I am just as
well capable of saying ‘The picture is bad’ as he is. To take a
coarse illustration, but one most exactly apposite, I can tell whether
a made dish be good or bad,—whether its taste be pleasant or disagreeable.—It
is dressed for the palate of uninitiated people, and
not alone for the disciples of Dr. Kitchener and Mr. Ude. But it
needs a cook to tell one <em>why</em> it is bad; that there is a grain too much
of this, or a drop too much of t’other—that it has been boiled rather
too much, or stewed rather too little—these things, the wherefores,
as ‘Squire Western would say, I require an artist to tell me,—but
the point in debate—the worth or the bad quality of the painting
or potage, I am as well able to decide upon as any he who ever
brandished a pallet or a pan, a brush or a skimming-ladle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>To go into the higher branches of the art—the poetry of painting—I
deny still more peremptorily the exclusiveness of the initiated.
It might be as well said, that none but those who could write a play
have any right to sit on the third row in the pit, on the first night of
a new tragedy. Nay, there is more plausibility in the one than the
other. No man can judge of poetry without possessing in some
measure a poetical mind. It need not be of that degree necessary
to create, but it must be equal to taste and to analyze. Now in
painting there is a directly mechanical power required to render those
imaginations, to the judging of which the mind may be perfectly
competent. I may know what is a just or a beautiful representation
of love, anger, madness, despair, without being able to draw a straight
line—and I do not see how that faculty adds to the capability of so
judging. A very great proportion of painting is mechanical. The
higher kinds of painting need first a poet’s mind to conceive:—Very
well, but then they need a draughtsman’s hand to execute. Now he
who possesses the mind alone is fully able to judge of what is produced,
even though he is by no means endowed with the mechanical
power of producing it himself. I am far from saying that <em>any</em> one
is capable of duly judging pictures of the higher class. It requires
a mind capable of estimating the noble, or touching, or terrible, or
sublime subjects which they present—but there is no sort of necessity
that we should be able to put them upon the canvas ourselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one point, even, on which painters usually judge worse
of pictures than the general spectator; I say usually, for there are
<em>some</em> painters who are too thoroughly intellectual to run into the error
of which I am about to speak. I mean that they are apt to overlook
the higher and more mental parts of a picture, in their haste to
criticise its mechanical properties. They forget the <em>expression</em>, in
being too mindful of what is more strictly manual. They talk of
such a colour being skilfully or unskillfully put in opposition to
another, rather than of the moral contrast of the countenances of a
group. They say that the flesh-tints are well brought out, before
they speak of the face which the flesh forms. To use a French
term of much condensation, they think of the <em>physique</em> before they
bestow any attention on the <em>morale</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am the farthest in the world from falling into the absurdity of
upholding that painters should neglect the mechanical parts of their
profession; for without a mastery in them it would be impossible to
body forth any imaginations, however strong or beautiful. I only
wish that they should not overlook the end to which these are the
means—and give them an undue preference over that end itself. Still
more I object to their arrogating to the possessors of these qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>of hand and eye all power of judging that which is conveyed through
the physical vision into the inward soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>On looking over what I have written, I find that I have used
some expressions with regard to painters as a body which may make
it appear that I hold them in light esteem; whereas no one can
admire their art, or appreciate their pursuit of it, more highly than
I do. Of what I have said, however, with regard to their paltry
denial of each other’s merits, I cannot bate them an ace. I appeal
to all those who are in the habit of associating with painters to say
whether my assertion be not correct. And why should they do
this?—surely the field is wide enough. Haydon and Wilkie can
travel to fame together without ever jostling each other by the way.
Surely there are parallel roads which may be followed, each leading
to the same point—but neither crossing or trenching upon one
another.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Art of Painting is one equally delightful to the eye and to
the mind. It has very nearly the reality of dramatic exhibition,
and has permanence, which that is wholly without. We may gaze
at a picture, and pause to think, and turn and gaze again. The art
is inferior to poetry in magnitude of extent and succession of detail—but
its power over any one point is far superior: it seizes it, and
figures it forth in corporeal existence if not in bodily life. It gives
to the eye the physical semblance of those figures which have floated
in vagueness in the mind. It condenses indistinct and gauzy visions
into palpable forms—as, in the story, the morning mist gathered into
the embodying a spirit. But shall it be said that the enchanter alone
can judge of the enchantment—that none shall have an eye to see,
and a heart to feel, unless he have also a hand to execute? Alas,
our inherent perceptions give the lie to this. As I used to go to
the Louvre, day after day, to glut myself and revel in the congregated
genius of pictorial ages, would any one convince me that
it was necessary to be able to paint that I might duly appreciate a
picture?</p>

<h3 class='c003'>THE VATICAN</h3>

<p class='c008'><em>L.</em> The Vatican did not quite answer your expectation?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> To say the truth, it was not such a blow as the Louvre; but
then it came after it, and what is more, at the distance of twenty
years. To have made the same impression, it should have been
twenty times as fine; though that was scarcely possible, since all that
there is fine in the Vatican, in Italy, or in the world, was in the
Louvre when I first saw it, except the frescoes of Raphael and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>Michael Angelo, which could not be transported, without taking the
walls of the building, across the Alps.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> And what, may I ask (for I am curious to hear,) did you
think of these same frescoes?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> Much the same as before I saw them. As far as I could
judge, they are very like the prints. I do not think the spectator’s
idea of them is enhanced beyond this. The Raphaels, of which you
have a distinct and admirable view, are somewhat faded—I do not
mean in colour, but the outline is injured—and the Sibyls and
Prophets in the Sistine Chapel are painted on the ceiling at too great
a height for the eye to distinguish the faces as accurately as one
would wish. The features and expressions of the figures near the
bottom of the ‘Last Judgment’ are sufficiently plain, and horrible
enough they are.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> What was your opinion of the ‘Last Judgment’ itself?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> It is literally too big to be seen. It is like an immense field of
battle, or charnel-house, strewed with carcases and naked bodies: or
it is a shambles of Art. You have huge limbs apparently torn from
their bodies and stuck against the wall: anatomical dissections, backs
and diaphragms, tumbling ‘with hideous ruin and combustion down,’
neither intelligible groups, nor perspective, nor colour; you distinguish
the principal figure, that of Christ, only from its standing in
the centre of the picture, on a sort of island of earth, separated from
the rest of the subject by an inlet of sky. The whole is a scene of
enormous, ghastly confusion, in which you can only make out quantity
and number, and vast, uncouth masses of bones and muscles. It has
the incoherence and distortion of a troubled dream, without the
shadowiness; everything is here corporeal and of solid dimensions.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> But surely there must be something fine in the Sibyls and
Prophets, from the copies we have of them; justifying the high
encomiums of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and of so many others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> It appears to me that nothing can be finer as to form, attitude,
and outline. The whole conception is so far inimitably noble and
just; and all that is felt as wanting, is a proportionable degree of
expression in the countenances, though of this I am not sure, for the
height (as I said before) baffles a nice scrutiny. They look to me
unfinished, vague, and general. Like some fabulous figure from the
antique, the heads were brutal, the bodies divine. Or at most, the
faces were only continuations of and on a par with the physical form,
large and bold, and with great breadth of drawing, but no more the
seat of a vivifying spirit, or with a more powerful and marked
intelligence emanating from them, than from the rest of the limbs, the
hands, or even drapery. The filling up of the mind is, I suspect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>wanting, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">divinæ particula auræ</span></i>: there is prodigious and mighty
prominence and grandeur and simplicity in the features, but they are
not surcharged with meaning, with thought or passion, like Raphael’s,
‘the rapt soul sitting in the eyes.’ On the contrary, they seem only
to be half-informed, and might be almost thought asleep. They are
fine moulds, and contain a capacity of expression, but are not bursting,
teeming with it. The outward material shrine, or tabernacle, is
unexceptionable; but there is not superadded to it a revelation of the
workings of the mind within. The forms in Michael Angelo are
objects to admire in themselves: those of Raphael are merely a
language pointing to something beyond, and full of this ultimate
import.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> But does not the difference arise from the nature of the subjects?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> I should think, not. Surely, a Sibyl in the height of her
phrensy, or an inspired Prophet—‘seer blest’—in the act of receiving
or of announcing the will of the Almighty, is not a less fit subject for
the most exalted and impassioned expression than an Apostle, a Pope,
a Saint, or a common man. If you say that these persons are not
represented in the act of inspired communication, but in their ordinary
quiescent state,—granted; but such preternatural workings, as well as
the character and frame of mind proper for them, must leave their
shadowings and lofty traces behind them. The face that has once
held communion with the Most High, or been wrought to madness
by deep thought and passion, or that inly broods over its sacred or its
magic lore, must be ‘as a book where one may read strange matters,’
that cannot be opened without a correspondent awe and reverence.
But here is ‘neither the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night:’
neither the blaze of immediate inspiration nor the hallowed radiance,
the mystic gloomy light that follows it, so far as I was able to
perceive. I think it idle to say that Michael Angelo painted man in
the abstract, and so left the expression indeterminate, when he painted
prophets and other given characters in particular. He has painted
them on a larger scale, and cast their limbs in a gigantic mould to give
a dignity and command answering to their situations and high calling,
but I do not see the same high character and intensity of thought or
purpose impressed upon their countenances. Thus, nothing can be
nobler or more characteristic than the figure of the prophet Jeremiah.
It is not abstracted, but symbolical of the history and functions of the
individual. The whole figure bends and droops under a weight of
woe, like a large willow tree surcharged with showers. Yet there is
no peculiar expression of grief in one part more than another; the
head hangs down despondingly indeed, but so do the hands, the
clothes, and every part seems to labour under and be involved in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>complication of distress. Again, the prophet Ezra is represented
reading in a striking attitude of attention, and with the book held
close to him as if to lose no part of its contents in empty space:—all
this is finely imagined and designed, but then the book reflects back
none of its pregnant, hieroglyphic meaning on the face, which, though
large and stately, is an ordinary, unimpassioned, and even <em>unideal</em> one.
Daniel, again, is meant for a face of inward thought and musing, but
it might seem as if the compression of the features were produced by
external force as much as by involuntary perplexity. I might extend
these remarks to this artist’s other works; for instance, to the Moses,
of which the form and attitude express the utmost dignity and
energy of purpose, but the face wants a something of the intelligence
and expansive views of the Hebrew legislator. It is cut from the
same block, and by the same bold sweeping hand, as the sandals or
the drapery.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> Do you think there is any truth or value in the distinction
which assigns to Raphael the dramatic, and to Michael Angelo the
epic department of the art?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> Very little, I confess. It is so far true, that Michael Angelo
painted single figures, and Raphael chiefly groups; but Michael
Angelo gave life and action to his figures, though not the same
expression to the face. I think this arose from two circumstances.
First, from his habits as a sculptor, in which form predominates, and
in which the fixed lineaments are more attended to than the passing
inflections, which are neither so easily caught nor so well given in
sculpture as in painting. Secondly, it strikes me that Michael
Angelo, who was a strong, iron-built man, sympathised more with
the organic structure, with bones and muscles, than with the more
subtle and sensitive workings of that fine medullary substance called
the brain. He compounded man admirably of brass or clay, but did
not succeed equally in breathing into his nostrils the breath of life, of
thought or feeling. He has less humanity than Raphael, and I think
that he is also less divine, unless it be asserted that the body is less
allied to earth than the mind. Expression is, after all, the principal
thing. If Michael Angelo’s forms have, as I allow, an intellectual
character about them and a greatness of gusto, so that you would
almost say ‘his bodies thought;’ his faces, on the other hand, have
a drossy and material one. For example, in the figure of Adam
coming from the hand of his Creator, the composition, which goes on
the idea of a being starting into life at the touch of Omnipotence, is
sublime:—the figure of Adam, reclined at ease with manly freedom
and independence, is worthy of the original founder of our race; and
the expression of the face, implying passive resignation and the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>consciousness of existence, is in thorough keeping—but I see nothing
in the countenance of the Deity denoting supreme might and majesty.
The Eve, too, lying extended at the foot of the Forbidden Tree, has
an elasticity and buoyancy about it, that seems as if it could bound up
from the earth of its own accord, like a bow that has been bent. It
is all life and grace. The action of the head thrown back, and the
upward look, correspond to the rest. The artist was here at home.
In like manner, in the allegorical figures of Night and Morn at
Florence, the faces are ugly or distorted, but the contour and actions
of the limbs express dignity and power, in the very highest degree.
The legs of the figure of Night, in particular, are twisted into the
involutions of a serpent’s folds; the neck is curved like the horse’s,
and is clothed with thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> What, then, is the precise difference between him and Raphael,
according to your conception?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> As far as I can explain the matter, it seems to me that Michael
Angelo’s forms are finer, but that Raphael’s are more fraught with
meaning; that the rigid outline and disposable masses in the first are
more grand and imposing, but that Raphael puts a greater proportion
of sentiment into his, and calls into play every faculty of mind and
body of which his characters are susceptible, with greater subtilty
and intensity of feeling. Dryden’s lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A fiery soul that working out its way</div>
      <div class='line'>Fretted the pigmy body to decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er-inform’d the tenement of clay’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>do not exactly answer to Raphael’s character, which is mild and
thoughtful rather than fiery; nor is there any want either of grace or
grandeur in his figures; but the passage describes the ‘o’er-informing’
spirit that breathes through them, and the unequal struggle of the
expression to vent itself by more than ordinary physical means.
Raphael lived a much shorter time than Michael Angelo, who also
lived long after him; and there is no comparison between the
number, the variety, or the finished elegance of their works.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
Michael Angelo possibly lost himself in the material and instrumental
part of art, in embodying a technical theory, or in acquiring the
grammar of different branches of study, excelling in knowledge and in
gravity of pretension; whereas Raphael gave himself up to the
diviner or lovelier impulse that breathes its soul over the face of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>things, being governed by a sense of reality and of general truth.
There is nothing exclusive or repulsive in Raphael; he is open to all
impressions alike, and seems to identify himself with whatever he saw
that arrested his attention or could interest others. Michael Angelo
studied for himself, and raised objects to the standards of his conception,
by a <em>formula</em> or system: Raphael invented for others, and
was guided only by sympathy with them. Michael Angelo was
painter, sculptor, architect; but he might be said to make of each
art a shrine in which to build up the stately and gigantic stature of
his own mind:—Raphael was only a painter, but in that one art he
seemed to pour out all the treasures and various excellence of nature,
grandeur and scope of design, exquisite finishing, force, grace,
delicacy, the strength of man, the softness of woman, the playfulness
of infancy, thought, feeling, invention, imitation, labour, ease, and
every quality that can distinguish a picture, except colour. Michael
Angelo, in a word, stamped his own character on his works, or recast
Nature in a mould of his own, leaving out much that was excellent:
Raphael received his inspiration from without, and his genius caught
the lambent flame of grace, of truth, and grandeur, which are reflected
in his works with a light clear, transparent and unfading.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> Will you mention one or two things that particularly struck
you?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> There is a figure of a man leading a horse in the Attila, which
I think peculiarly characteristic. It is an ordinary face and figure,
in a somewhat awkward dress: but he seems as if he had literally
walked into the picture at that instant; he is looking forward with
a mixture of earnestness and curiosity, as if the scene were passing
before him, and every part of his figure and dress is flexible and in
motion, pliant to the painter’s plastic touch. This figure, so unconstrained
and free, animated, salient, put me in mind, compared
with the usual stiffness and shackles of the art, of chain-armour used
by the knights of old instead of coat-of-mail. Raphael’s fresco
figures seem the least of all others taken from plaster-casts; this is
more than can be said of Michael Angelo’s, which might be taken
from, or would serve for very noble ones. The horses in the same
picture also delight me. Though dumb, they appear as though they
could speak, and were privy to the import of the scene. Their
inflated nostrils and speckled skins are like a kind of proud flesh; or
they are animals spiritualised. In the Miracle of Bolsano is that
group of children, round-faced, smiling, with large-orbed eyes, like
infancy nestling in the arms of affection; the studied elegance of the
choir of tender novices, with all their sense of the godliness of their
function and the beauty of holiness; and the hard, liny, individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>portraits of priests and cardinals on the right-hand, which have the
same life, spirit, boldness, and marked character, as if you could have
looked in upon the assembled conclave. Neither painting nor popery
ever produced anything finer. There is the utmost hardness and
materiality of outline, with a spirit of fire. The School of Athens is
full of striking parts and ingenious contrasts; but I prefer to it the
Convocation of Saints, with that noble circle of Prophets and
Apostles in the sky, on whose bent foreheads and downcast eyes you
see written the City of the Blest, the beatific presence of the Most
High and the Glory hereafter to be revealed, a solemn brightness
and a fearful dream, and that scarce less inspired circle of sages
canonised here on earth, poets, heroes, and philosophers, with the
painter himself, entering on one side like the recording angel, smiling
in youthful beauty, and scarce conscious of the scene he has embodied.
If there is a failure in any of these frescoes, it is, I think, in the
Parnassus, in which there is something quaint and affected. In the
St. Peter delivered from prison, he has burst with Rembrandt into
the dark chambers of night, and thrown a glory round them. In the
story of Cupid and Psyche, at the Little Farnese, he has, I think,
even surpassed himself in a certain swelling and voluptuous grace, as
if beauty grew and ripened under his touch, and the very genius of
ancient fable hovered over his enamoured pencil.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> I believe you when you praise, not always when you condemn.
Was there anything else that you saw to give you a higher idea of
him than the specimens we have in this country?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> Nothing superior to the Cartoons for boldness of design and
execution; but I think his best oil pictures are abroad, though I had
seen most of them before in the Louvre. I had not, however, seen
the Crowning of the Virgin, which is in the Picture-gallery of the
Vatican, and appears to me one of his very highest-wrought pictures.
The Virgin in the clouds is of an admirable sedateness and dignity,
and over the throng of breathing faces below there is poured a stream
of joy and fervid devotion that can be compared to nothing but the
golden light that evening skies pour on the edges of the surging
waves. ‘Hope elevates, and joy brightens their every feature.’ The
Foligno Virgin was at Paris, in which I cannot say I am quite
satisfied with the Madonna; it has rather a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">précieuse</span></i> expression; but
I know not enough how to admire the innumerable heads of cherubs
surrounding her, touched in with such care and delicacy, yet so as
scarcely to be perceptible except on close inspection, nor that figure
of the winged cherub below, offering the casket, and with his round,
chubby face and limbs as full of rosy health and joy, as the cup is
full of the juice of the purple vine. There is another picture of his I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>will mention, the Leo <span class='fss'>X.</span> in the Palace Pitti, ‘on his front engraven
thought and public care; ‘and again, that little portrait in a cup in the
Louvre, muffled in thought and buried in a kind of mental <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro
scuro</span></i>. When I think of these and so many other of his inimitable
works, ‘scattered like stray-gifts o’er the earth,’ meeting our thoughts
half-way, and yet carrying them farther than we should have been able
of ourselves, enriching, refining, exalting all around, I am at a loss
to find motives for equal admiration or gratitude in what Michael
Angelo has left, though his Prophets and Sibyls on the walls of the
Sistine Chapel are <em>thumping make-weights</em> thrown into the opposite
scale. It is nearly impossible to weigh or measure their different merits.
Perhaps Michael Angelo’s works, in their vastness and unity, may
give a greater blow to some imaginations and lift the mind more out
of itself, though accompanied with less delight or food for reflection,
resembling the rocky precipice, whose ‘stately height though bare’
overlooks the various excellence and beauty of subjected art.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> I do not think your premises warrant your conclusion. If
what you have said of each is true, I should give the undoubted preference
to Raphael as at least the greater painter, if not the greater
man. I must prefer the finest face to the largest mask.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> I wish you could see and judge for yourself.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L.</em> I prythee do not mock me. Proceed with your account.
Was there nothing else worth mentioning after Raphael and Michael
Angelo?</p>

<p class='c000'><em>H.</em> So much, that it has slipped from my memory. There are the
finest statues in the world there, and they are scattered and put into
niches or separate little rooms for effect, and not congregated together
like a meeting of the marble gods of mythology, as was the case in
the Louvre. There are some of Canova’s, worked up to a high
pitch of perfection, which might just as well have been left alone—and
there are none, I think, equal to the Elgin marbles. A bath of
one of the Antonines, of solid porphyry and as large as a good-sized
room, struck me as the strongest proof of ancient magnificence. The
busts are innumerable, inimitable, have a breathing clearness and
transparency, revive ancient history, and are very like actual English
heads and characters. The inscriptions alone on fragments of antique
marble would furnish years of study to the curious or learned in that
way. The vases are most elegant—of proportions and materials
unrivalled in taste and in value. There are some tapestry copies of
the Cartoons, very glaring and unpleasant to look at. The room
containing the coloured maps of Italy, done about three hundred years
ago, is one of the longest and most striking; and the passing through
it with the green hillocks, rivers, and mountains on its spotty sides, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>like going a delightful and various journey. You recall or anticipate
the most interesting scenes and objects. Out of the windows of
these long straggling galleries, you look down into a labyrinth of
inner and of outer courts, or catch the Dome of St Peter’s adjoining
(like a huge shadow), or gaze at the distant amphitheatre of hills
surrounding the Sacred City, which excite a pleasing awe, whether
considered as the haunts of banditti or from a recollection of the
wondrous scene, the hallowed spot, on which they have overlooked
for ages, Imperial or Papal Rome, or her commonwealth, more august
than either. Here also in one chamber of the Vatican is a room
stuffed full of artists, copying the Transfiguration, or the St. Jerome
of Domenichino, spitting, shrugging, and taking snuff, admiring their
own performances and sneering at those of their neighbours; and on
certain days of the week the whole range of the rooms is thrown open
without reserve to the entire population of Rome and its environs,
priests and peasants, with heads not unlike those that gleam from the
walls, perfect in expression and in costume, and young peasant girls
in clouted shoes with looks of pleasure, timidity and wonder, such as
those with which Raphael himself, from the portraits of him, might
be supposed to have hailed the dawn of heaven-born art. There is
also (to mention small works with great) a portrait of George the
Fourth in his robes (a present to his Holiness) turned into an outer
room; and a tablet erected by him in St. Peter’s, to the memory of
James <span class='fss'>III.</span> Would you believe it? Cosmo Comyne Bradwardine,
when he saw the averted looks of the good people of England as
they proclaimed his Majesty James <span class='fss'>III.</span> in any of the towns through
which they passed, would not have believed it. Fergus Maclvor,
when in answer to the crier of the court, who repeated ‘Long live
King George!’ he retorted, ‘Long live King James!’ would not
have believed it possible!</p>

<p class='c008'>Rome is of all places the worst to study in, for the same reason
that it is the best to lounge in. There is no end of objects to divert
and distract the mind. If a person has no other view than to pass
away his time, to fill his portfolio or common-place book, or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>improve his general taste and knowledge, he may find employment
and amusement here for ever: if ever he wishes to do any thing, he
should fly from it as he would from the plague. There is a species
of <em>malaria</em> hanging over it, which infects both the mind and the body.
It has been the seat of too much activity and luxury formerly, not to
have produced a correspondent torpor and stagnation (both in the
physical and moral world) as the natural consequence at present. If
Necessity is the mother of Invention it must be stifled in the birth
here, where every thing is already done and provided to your hand
that you could possibly wish for or think of. You have no stimulus
to exertion, for you have but to open your eyes and see, in order to
live in a continued round of delight and admiration. The doors of a
splendid banquet of all that is rare and rich in art stand ready open
to you, you are invited to enter in and feast your senses and your
imagination <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gratis</span></i>; and it is not likely that, under these circumstances,
you will try to earn a scanty meal by hard labour, or even to gain an
appetite by wholesome exercise. The same thing occurs here that is
objected to the inhabitants of great cities in general. They have
too many objects always passing before them, that engage their
attention and fill up their time, to allow them either much leisure or
inclination for thought or study. Rome is the great metropolis of
Art; and it is somewhat to be feared that those who take up their
abode there will become, like other <em>cockneys</em>, ignorant, conceited,
and superficial.</p>

<p class='c000'>The queen and mistress of the ancient and the modern world claims
such a transcendent superiority over the mind, that you look down as
it were from this eminence on the rest of mankind; and from the
contempt you feel for others, come to have a mighty good opinion of
yourself. The <em>being</em> at Rome (both from the sound of the name and
the monuments of genius and magnificence she has to show) is of
itself a sufficient distinction without <em>doing</em> anything there. After
viewing some splendid relic of antiquity, the efforts of contemporary
art sink into insignificance and nothingness: but we are disposed to
occupy the vacant space, the clear ground thus created, with our own
puny pretensions and aspiring fancies. As this indulgence of alternate
enthusiasm and reflected self-complacency is a never-failing source of
gratification, and a much less laborious one than the embodying our
vain imaginations in practice, we easily rest in the means as the end;
and without making any farther progress, are perfectly satisfied with
what others have done, and what we <em>are</em> to do. We indeed wear
the livery, and follow in the train of greatness; and, like other livery-servants,
despise the rabble, growing more lazy, affected, luxurious,
insolent, trifling, and incapable of gaining an honest livelihood every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>hour. We are the dupes of flattering appearances and of false comparisons
between ourselves and others. We think that a familiarity
with great names and great works is an approach to an equality with
them; or fondly proceed to establish our own pretensions on the
ruins of others, not considering that if it were not what we <em>do</em>, but
what we <em>see</em>, that is the standard of proficiency, thousands of spectators
might give themselves the same airs of self-importance on the
same idle score, and treat us as barbarians and poor creatures, if they
had our impertinence and presumption. We stand before a picture
of some great master, and fancy there is nothing between him and us:
we walk under the Dome of St. Peter’s, and it seems to grow larger
with a consciousness of our presence and with the amplitude of our
conceptions. All this is fine as well as easy work; nor can it be
supposed that we shall be in any haste to exchange this waking
dream for the drudgery of mechanical exertion, or for the mortifying
evidence of the disparity between our theory and our practice. All
the great names and schools of art stand proxy for us, till we choose
to take the responsibility on our own shoulders; and as it happens in
other cases, we have no objection to make our faith in the merits of
others a convenient substitute for good works and zealous exertions
in the cause. Yet a common stone-mason or sign-painter, who
understands the use of his tools and sticks close to his business, has
more resemblance to Raphael or Michael Angelo, and stands a
better chance of achieving something great, than those who visit the
Corridors of the Vatican or St. Peter’s once a day, return home,
spend the evening in extolling what they have witnessed, begin a sketch
or a plan and lay it aside, and saunter out again the next day in search
of fresh objects to dissipate <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> and kill the time without being obliged
to draw for one instant on their own resources or resolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Numberless are the instances of those who go on thus, while vanity
and indolence together are confirmed into an incurable disease, the
sleek, pampered tone of which they mistake for the marks of taste
and genius. What other result can be expected? If they do any thing,
it is all over with them. They not only strip off the mask from their
own self-love, but expose themselves to the pity and derision of their
competitors, whom they before affected to despise. Within ‘the
vast, the unbounded’ circle of pretension, of vapouring, and inuendo,
they are safe: the future <em>would-be</em> Raphaels, Correggios, &amp;c. have
nothing to dread from criticism while they hatch their embryo
conquests and prepare a distant triumph: no one can apply Ithuriel’s
spear to detect what is confessedly a shadow. But they must waive
this privilege when they descend into the common lists; and in
proportion as they have committed themselves in conversation or in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>idle fancy, they are ashamed to commit themselves in reality, because
any thing they could do at first must unavoidably fall short of that
high standard of excellence, which (if at all) can only be attained by
the labour and experience of a whole life. Their real incapacity
shrinks from the pomp of their professions. The magnificence of
the air-drawn edifice of their reputation prevents them from laying the
first stone in downright earnest; and they have no other mode of
excusing the delay, and the indecision it betokens, than by assuming
still greater delicacy of taste and loftiness of ambition, and by thus
aggrandising their unfounded schemes, rendering their execution more
hopeless and impossible. Should they begin something, a new
thought strikes them, and they throw aside a very promising sketch
to enlarge their canvass and proceed upon a scale more worthy of
them: to this enlarged design some object is indispensably necessary,
which is unluckily wanting:—thus time is gained, a new lease of
credit is granted, and instead of putting the last hand to the original
sketch, they take merit to themselves for the enlargement of their
views and the determined pursuit of the higher walk of art. Meantime,
the smaller picture stands unfinished on the easel, and nominal
commissions pour in for new and more extended projects. Then
comes a new secret of colouring, a new principle of grouping, a new
theory, a new book—always something to draw off the attention from
its proper object, and to substitute laborious idleness for true pains
and profitable study. Then a picture is to be copied as a preparation
for undertaking a given subject, or a library to be ransacked to
ascertain the precise truth of the historical facts or the exact conception
of the characters; and after a year thus lost in desultory and
scrupulous researches, the whole plan is given up, either because no
one comes forward effectually to patronise it, or because some more
tempting prospect is opened into the realms of art and high renown.
Then again friends are to be consulted; some admire one thing,
some another; some recommend the study of nature, others are all
for the antique; some insist on the utmost finishing, others explode
all attention to <em>minutiæ</em>; artists find one fault, the uninstructed spectator
another; and in going backwards and forwards from one to another,
listening to new reasons and new objections, in reconciling all parties
and pleasing none, life is passed in endless doubts and difficulties,
and we discover that our most valuable years have fled in busy
preparations to do—nothing. It is then too late, and we consume
the remainder in vain regrets and querulous repinings, as we did the
flower and marrow of our time in fanciful speculation and egregious
trifling. The student should of all things steer clear of the character
of the dilettanti—it is the rock on which he is most likely to split.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>Pleasure, or extravagance, or positive idleness, are less dangerous;
for these he knows to be fatal to his success, and he indulges in them
with his eyes open. But in the other case, he is thrown off his guard
by the most plausible appearances. Vanity here puts on the garb of
humility, indecision of long-sighted perseverance, and habitual sloth
of constant industry. Few will reproach us, while we are accumulating
the means of ultimate success, with neglecting the end; or
remind us that though art is long, life is short. It is true, that art is
a long and steep ascent, but we must learn to scale it by regular,
practical stages, and not by a hasty wish or still more futile calculations
and measurements of the height. We can only indeed be
sensible of its real height by the actual progress we have made, and
by the glorious views that gradually dawn upon us, the cheerers of
our way, and the harbingers of our success. It is only by attempting
something that we feel where our strength lies, and if we have what
travellers call a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte journée</span></i> to perform, it is the more indispensable
that we should set out betimes and not loiter on the road. What is
well done is the consequence of doing much—perfection is the reward
of numberless attempts and failures. The chief requisites are a
practised hand and eye, and an active imagination. Indolent taste
and passive acquirements are not enough. They will neither supply
our wants while living, nor enable us to leave a name behind us after
we are dead. Farther, the brooding over excellence with a feverish
importunity, and stimulating ourselves to great things by an abstract
love of fame, can do little good, and may do much harm. It is, no
doubt, a very delightful and enviable state of mind to be in, but
neither a very arduous nor a very profitable one. Nothing remarkable
was ever done, except by following up the impulse of our own minds,
by grappling with difficulties and improving our advantages, not by
dreaming over our own premature triumphs or doating on the achievements
of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it were nothing else, the having the works of the great masters
of former times always before us is enough to discourage and defeat
all ordinary attempts. How many elegant designs and meritorious
conceptions must lie buried under the high arched porticoes of the
Vatican! The walls of the Sistine Chapel must fall upon the head
of inferior pretensions and crush them. What minor pencil can
stand in competition with the ‘petrific mace’ that painted the Last
Judgment? What fancy can expand into blooming grace and
beauty by the side of the Heliodorus? What is it <em>we</em> could add, or
what occasion, what need, what pretence is there to add anything to
the art after this? Who in the presence of such glorious works does
not wish to shrink into himself, or to live only for them? Is it not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>profanation to think he can hope to do any thing like them? And
who, having once seen, can think with common patience or with
zealous enthusiasm of doing aught but treading in their footsteps?
If the artist has a genius and turn of mind at all similar, they baulk
and damp him by their imposing stately height: if his talent lies in a
different and humbler walk, they divert and unsettle his mind. If he
is contented to look on and admire, a vague and unattainable idea of
excellence floats before his imagination, and tantalises him with
equally vain hopes and wishes. If he copies, he becomes a mechanic;
and besides, runs another risk. He finds he can with ease produce
in three days an incomparably finer effect than he could do with all
his efforts, and after any length of time, in working without assistance.
He is therefore disheartened and put out of countenance, and returns
with reluctance to original composition: for where is the sense of
taking ten times the pains and undergoing ten times the anxiety to
produce not one hundredth part of the effect? When I was young,
I made one or two studies of strong contrasts of light and shade in
the manner of Rembrandt with great care and (as it was thought)
with some success. But after I had once copied some of Titian’s
portraits in the Louvre, my ambition took a higher flight. Nothing
would serve my turn but heads like Titian—Titian expressions, Titian
complexions, Titian dresses; and as I could not find these where I
was, after one or two abortive attempts to engraft Italian art on
English nature, I flung away my pencil in disgust and despair.
Otherwise I might have done as well as others, I dare say, but from
a desire to do too well. I did not consider that Nature is always the
great thing, or that ‘Pan is a god, Apollo is no more!’—Nor is the
student repelled and staggered in his progress only by the degree of
excellence, but distracted and puzzled by the variety of incompatible
claims upon his ingenuous and sincere enthusiasm. While any one
attends to what circumstances bring in his way, or keeps in the path
that is prompted by his own genius (such as it may be), he stands a
fair chance, by directing all his efforts to one point, to compass the
utmost object of his ambition. But what likelihood is there of this
from the moment that all the great schools, and all the most precious
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i> of art, at once unveil their diversified attractions to his
astonished sight? What Protestant, for instance, can be properly
and permanently imbued with the fervent devotion or saint-like purity
of the Catholic religion, or hope to transfer the pride, pomp, and
pageantry of that detested superstition to his own canvass, with real
feeling and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>? What modern can enter fully into the spirit
of the ancient Greek mythology, or rival the symmetry of its naked
forms? What single individual will presume to unite ‘the colouring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>of Titian, the drawing of Raphael, the airs of Guido, the learning of
Poussin, the purity of Domenichino, the <em>correggiescity</em> of Correggio,
and the grand contour of Michael Angelo,’ in the same composition?
Yet those who are familiar with all these different styles and their
excellences, require them all. Mere originality will not suffice, it is
quaint and Gothic—common-place perfection is still more intolerable,
it is insipid and mechanical. Modern Art is indeed like the fabled
Sphinx, that imposes impossible tasks on her votaries, and as she
clasps them to her bosom pierces them to the heart. Let a man have
a turn and taste for landscape, she whispers him that nothing is truly
interesting but the human face: if he makes a successful <em>debut</em> in
portrait, he soon (under the same auspices) aspires to history; but if
painting in its highest walks seems within his reach, she then plays
off the solid forms and shining surfaces of sculpture before his eyes,
urging him to combine the simple grandeur of the Antique with
Canova’s polished elegance; or he is haunted with the majestic effects
and scientific rules of architecture, and ruined temples and broken
fragments nod in his bewildered imagination! What is to be done in
this case? What generally is done—Nothing. Amidst so many
pretensions, how is choice possible? Or where all are equally objects
of taste and knowledge, how rest satisfied without giving some proofs
of our practical proficiency in all? To mould a clay-figure that if
finished might surpass the Venus; to make a pen-and-ink drawing
after a splendid piece of colouring by Titian; to give the picturesque
effect of the arch of some ancient aqueduct as seen by moonlight;
some such meagre abstractions and flimsy refinements in art are among
the <em>spolia opima</em> and patchwork trophies offered to the presiding
Goddess of spleen, idleness, and affectation!—</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing can be conceived more unpropitious to ‘the high endeavour
and the glad success,’ than the whole aspect and character of ancient
Rome, both what remains as well as what is lost of it. Is this the
Eternal City? Is this she that (amazon or votaress) was twice
mistress of the world? Is this the country of the Scipios, the
Cincinnati and the Gracchi, of Cato and of Brutus, of Pompey and
of Sylla, is this the Capitol where Julius Cæsar fell, where Cicero
thundered against Catiline, the scene of combats and of triumphs, and
through whose gates kings and nations were led captive by the side
of their conquerors’ chariot-wheels? All is vanished. The names
alone remain to haunt the memory: the spirits of the mighty dead
mock us, as we pass. The genius of Antiquity bestrides the place
like a Colossus. Ruin here sits on her pedestal of pride, and reads a
mortifying lecture to human vanity. We see all that ages, nations,
a subjected world conspired to build up to magnificence, overthrown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>or hastening fast into decay; empire, religion, freedom, Gods and
men trampled in the dust or consigned to the regions of lasting
oblivion or of shadowy renown; and what are we that in this mighty
wreck we should think of cultivating our petty talents and advancing
our individual pretensions? Rome is the very tomb of ancient greatness,
the grave of modern presumption. The mere consciousness of
the presence in which we stand ought to abash and overawe our
pragmatical self-conceit. Men here seem no better than insects
crawling about: everything has a Lilliputian and insignificant appearance.
Our big projects, our bloated egotism, shrink up within the
enormous shadow of transitory power and splendour: the sinews of
desire relax and moulder away, and the fever of youthful ambition is
turned into a cold ague-fit. There is a languor in the air; and the
contagion of listless apathy infects the hopes that are yet unborn.—As
to what remains of actual power and spiritual authority, Hobbes said
well, that ‘Popery was the ghost of the Roman Empire, sitting upon
the ruins of Rome.’ The only flourishing thing in Rome (and that
is only half flourishing) is an old woman; and who would wish to be
an old woman? Greatness here is greatness in masquerade—one
knows not whether to pity or laugh at it—and the Cardinals’ red legs
peeping out like the legs of some outlandish stuffed bird in a Museum,
excite much the same curiosity and surprise. No one (no Englishman
at least) can be much edified by the array of distinctions, that
denote a consummation of art or weakness. Still, perhaps, to the
idle and frivolous there may be something alluring in this meretricious
mummery and splendour, as moths are attracted to the taper’s blaze,
and perish in it!</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a great deal of gossiping and stuff going on at Rome.
There are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conversationes</span></i>, where the Cardinals go and admire the fair
complexions and innocent smiles of the young Englishwomen; and
where the English students who have the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entrée</span></i> look at the former
with astonishment as a sort of nondescripts, and are not the less taken
with their pretty countrywomen for being the objects of attention to
Popish Cardinals. Then come the tittle-tattle of who and who’s
together, the quaint and piquant inter-national gallantries, and the
story of the greatest beauty in Rome said to be married to an English
gentleman—how odd and at the same time how encouraging! Then
the manners and customs of Rome excite a buzz of curiosity, and the
English imagination is always recurring to and teazed with that luckless
question of <em>cicisbeism</em>. Some affect to be candid, while others
persist in their original blindness, and would set on foot a reform of
the Roman metropolis—on the model of the British one! In short,
there is a great deal too much tampering and dalliance with subjects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>with which we have little acquaintance and less business. All this
passes the time, and relieves the mind either after the fatigue or in
the absence of more serious study. Then there is to be an Academy
Meeting at night, and a debate is to take place whether the Academy
ought not to have a President, and if so, whether the President of
the Academy at Rome ought not (out of respect) to be a Royal
Academician, thus extending the links in the chain of professional
intrigue and cabal from one side of the Continent to the other. A
speech is accordingly to be made, a motion seconded, which requires
time and preparation—or a sudden thought strikes the more raw and
heedless adventurer, but is lost for want of words to express it—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vox
faucibus hæsit</span></i>, and the cast of the Theseus looks dull and lumpish as the
disappointed candidate for popular applause surveys it by the light of
his lamp in retiring to his chamber, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sedet infelix Theseus</span></i>, &amp;c. So
the next day Gibbon is bought and studied with great avidity to give
him a command of tropes and figures at their next meeting. The
arrival of some new lord or squire of high degree or clerical virtuoso
is announced, and a cabal immediately commences, who is to share
his patronage, who is to guide his taste, who is to show him the <em>lions</em>,
who is to pasquinade, epigrammatise or caricature him, and fix his
pretensions to taste and liberality as culminating from the zenith
or sunk below zero. Everything here is transparent and matter of
instant notoriety: nothing can be done in a corner. The English
are comparatively few in number, and from their being in a foreign
country are objects of importance to one another as well as of curiosity
to the natives. All ranks and classes are blended together for mutual
attack or defence. The patron sinks into the companion; the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">protegé</span></i>
plays off the great man upon occasion. Indeed the grand airs and
haughty reserve of English manners are a little ridiculous and out of
place at Rome. You are glad to meet with any one who will bestow
his compassion and ‘his tediousness’ upon you. You want some
shelter from the insolence and indifference of the inhabitants, which
are very much calculated to repel the feelings, and throw you back
on your resources in common humanity or the partiality of your
fellow-countrymen. Nor is this the least inconvenience of a stranger’s
residence at Rome. You have to squabble with every one about you
to prevent being cheated, to drive a hard bargain in order to live, to
keep your hands and your tongue within strict bounds, for fear of
being stilettoed, or thrown into the Tower of St. Angelo, or remanded
home. You have much to do to avoid the contempt of the inhabitants;
if you fancy you can ingratiate yourself with them and play off
<em>the amiable</em>, you have a still more charming pursuit and bait for vanity
and idleness. You must run the gauntlet of sarcastic words or looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>for a whole street, of laughter or want of comprehension in reply to
all the questions you ask; or if a pretty black-browed girl puts on a
gracious aspect, and seems to interest herself in your perplexity, you
think yourself in high luck, and well repaid for a thousand affronts.
A smile from a Roman beauty must be well nigh fatal to many an
English student at Rome. In short, while abroad, and while our
self-love is continually coming into collision with that of others, and
neither knows what to make of the other, we are necessarily thinking
of ourselves and of them, and in no pleasant or profitable way. Every
thing is strange and new; we seem beginning life over again, and feel
like children or rustics. We have not learned the alphabet of civilization
and humanity: how, then, should we aspire to the height of Art?
We are taken up with ourselves as English travellers and English
students, when we should be thinking of something else. All the
petty intrigue, vexation, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tracasserie</span></i> of ordinary dealings, should
be banished as much as possible from the mind of the student, who
requires to have his whole time and faculties to himself; all ordinary
matters should go on mechanically of themselves, without giving him
a moment’s uneasiness or interruption; but here they are forced upon
him with tenfold sharpness and frequency, hurting his temper and
hindering his time. Instead of ‘tearing from his memory all trivial,
fond records,’ that he may devote himself to the service of Art, and
that ‘<em>her</em> commandment all alone may live within the book and
volume of his brain, unmixed with baser matter,’ he is never free
from the most pitiful annoyances—they follow him into the country,
sit down with him at home, meet him in the street, take him by the
button, whisper in his ear, prevent his sleeping, waken him before the
dawn, and plague him out of his very life, making it resemble a restless
dream or an ill-written romance. Under such disadvantages,
should an artist do anything, the Academy which has sent him out
should lose no time in sending for him back again; for there is
nothing that may not be expected from an English student at Rome
who has not become an idler, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitre</span></i>, and a busy-body! Or if
he is still unwilling to quit classic ground, is chained by the soft
fetters of the climate or of a fair face, or likes to see the morning
mist rise from the Marshes of the Campagna and circle round the
Dome of St. Peter’s, and that to sever him from these would be to
sever soul from body, let him go to Gensano, stop there for five years,
visiting Rome only at intervals, wander by Albano’s gleaming lake
and wizard grottoes, make studies of the heads and dresses of the
peasant-girls in the neighbourhood, those Goddesses of health and
good-temper, embody them to the life, and show (as the result) what
the world never saw before!</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>FINE ARTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Objects of the Article.</span>—In the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite> there is some
account, under the head <span class='sc'>Arts</span>, of the general theory and history of
the <em>Fine Arts</em>, including Poetry, Eloquence, Painting, Statuary, and
Architecture. The term, in its widest application, would also
embrace Music, Dancing, Theatrical Exhibition; and in general,
all those arts, in which the powers of imitation or invention are
exerted, chiefly with a view to the production of pleasure, by the
immediate impression which they make on the mind. The phrase
has of late, we think, been restricted to a narrower and more
technical signification; namely, to Painting, Sculpture, Engraving,
and Architecture, which appeal to the eye as the medium of pleasure;
and by way of eminence, to the two first of these arts. In the
present article, we shall adopt this limited sense of the term;
and shall endeavour to develope the principles upon which the great
Masters have proceeded, and also to inquire, in a more particular
manner, into the state and probable advancement of these arts in this
Country.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ruling Principle of the Fine Arts.</span>—The great works of art,
at present extant, and which may be regarded as models of perfection
in their several kinds, are the Greek statues—the pictures of
the celebrated Italian Masters—those of the Dutch and Flemish
schools—to which we may add the comic productions of our own
countryman, Hogarth. These all stand unrivalled in the history
of art; and they owe their pre-eminence and perfection to one
and the same principle,—<em>the immediate imitation of nature</em>. This
principle predominated equally in the classical forms of the antique,
and in the grotesque figures of Hogarth; the perfection of art in
each arose from the truth and identity of the imitation with the
reality; the difference was in the subjects; there was none in the
mode of imitation. Yet the advocates for the <em>ideal system of art</em>
would persuade their disciples, that the difference between Hogarth
and the antique does not consist in the different forms of nature which
they imitated, but in this, that the one is like, and the other unlike
nature. This is an error, the most detrimental, perhaps, of all others,
both to the theory and practice of art. As, however, the prejudice
is very strong and general, and supported by the highest authority, it
will be necessary to go somewhat elaborately into the question in
order to produce an impression on the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>What has given rise to the common notion of the <em>ideal</em>, as something
quite distinct from <em>actual</em> nature, is probably the perfection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>the Greek statues. Not seeing among ourselves any thing to
correspond in beauty and grandeur, either with the features or form
of the limbs in these exquisite remains of antiquity, it was an obvious,
but a superficial conclusion, that they must have been created from
the idea existing in the artist’s mind, and could not have been copied
from anything existing in nature. The contrary, however, is the
fact. The general form, both of the face and figure, which we
observe in the old statues, is not an ideal abstraction, is not a fanciful
invention of the sculptor, but is as completely local and national
(though it happens to be more beautiful) as the figures on a Chinese
screen, or a copperplate engraving of a negro chieftain in a book of
travels. It will not be denied that there is a difference of physiognomy
as well as of complexion in different races of men. The Greek form
appears to have been naturally beautiful, and they had, besides, every
advantage of climate, of dress, of exercise, and modes of life to
improve it. The artist had also every facility afforded him in the
study and knowledge of the human form, and their religious and
public institutions gave him every encouragement in the prosecution of
his art. All these causes contributed to the perfection of these
noble productions; but we should be inclined principally to attribute
the superior symmetry of form common to the Greek statues, in the
first place, to the superior symmetry of the models in nature, and in
the second, to the more constant opportunities for studying them. If
we allow, also, for the superior genius of the people, we shall not be
wrong; but this superiority consisted in their peculiar susceptibility
to the impressions of what is beautiful and grand in nature. It may
be thought an objection to what has just been said, that the antique
figures of animals, &amp;c., are as fine, and proceed on the same principles
as their statues of gods or men. But all that follows from this seems
to be, that their art had been perfected in the study of the human
form, the test and proof of power and skill; and was then transferred
easily to the general imitation of all other objects, according to their
true characters, proportions, and appearances. As a confirmation of
these remarks, the antique portraits of individuals were often superior
even to the personifications of their gods. We think that no
unprejudiced spectator of real taste can hesitate for a moment in
preferring the head of the Antinous, for example, to that of the
Apollo. And in general, it may be laid down as a rule, that the most
perfect of the antiques are the most simple;—those which affect the
least action, or violence of passion;—which repose the most on
natural beauty of form, and a certain expression of sweetness and
dignity, that is, which remain most nearly in that state in which they
could be copied from nature without straining the limbs or features of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the individual, or racking the invention of the artist. This tendency
of Greek art to repose has indeed been reproached with insipidity by
those who had not a true feeling of beauty and sentiment. We,
however, prefer these models of habitual grace or internal grandeur to
the violent distortions of suffering in the Laocoon, or even to the
supercilious air of the Apollo. The Niobe, more than any other
antique head, combines truth and beauty with deep passion. But
here the passion is fixed, intense, habitual;—it is not a sudden or
violent gesticulation, but a settled mould of features; the grief it
expresses is such as might almost turn the human countenance itself
<em>into marble</em>!</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, then, we would be understood to maintain, that the
beauty and grandeur so much admired in the Greek statues were not
a voluntary fiction of the brain of the artist, but existed substantially
in the forms from which they were copied, and by which the artist
was surrounded. A striking authority in support of these observations,
which has in some measure been lately discovered, is to be
found in the <cite>Elgin marbles</cite>, taken from the Acropolis at Athens, and
supposed to be the works of the celebrated Phidias. The process of
fastidious refinement and indefinite abstraction is certainly not visible
there. The figures have all the ease, the simplicity, and variety, of
individual nature. Even the details of the subordinate parts, the
loose hanging folds in the skin, the veins under the belly or on the
sides of the horses, more or less swelled as the animal is more or less
in action, are given with scrupulous exactness. This is true nature
and true art. In a word, these invaluable remains of antiquity are
precisely like casts taken from life. The <em>ideal</em> is not the preference
of that which exists only in the mind, to that which exists in nature;
but the preference of that which is fine in nature to that which is less
so. There is nothing fine in art but what is taken almost immediately,
and, as it were, in the mass, from what is finer in nature. Where
there have been the finest models in nature, there have been the
finest works of art.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Greek statues were copied from Greek forms, so Raphael’s
expressions were taken from Italian faces; and we have heard it
remarked, that the women in the streets at Rome seem to have walked
out of his pictures in the Vatican.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Joshua Reynolds constantly refers to Raphael as the highest
example in modern times (at least with one exception) of the grand
or ideal style; and yet he makes the essence of that style to consist
in the embodying of an abstract or general idea, formed in the mind
of the artist by rejecting the peculiarities of individuals, and retaining
only what is common to the species. Nothing can be more inconsistent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>than the style of Raphael with this definition. In his
Cartoons and in his groupes in the Vatican, there is hardly a face or
figure which is any thing more than fine individual nature finely
disposed and copied. The late Mr. Barry, who could not be
suspected of a prejudice on this side of the question, speaks thus of
them: “In Raphael’s pictures (at the Vatican) of the <cite>Dispute of the
Sacrament</cite>, and the <cite>School of Athens</cite>, one sees all the heads to be
entirely copied from particular characters in nature, nearly proper for
the persons and situations which he adapts them to; and he seems to
me only to add and take away what may answer his purpose in little
parts, features, &amp;c.; conceiving, while he had the head before him,
ideal characters and expressions, which he adapts these features and
peculiarities of face to. This attention to the particulars which
distinguish all the different faces, persons, and characters, the one
from the other, gives his pictures quite the verity and unaffected
dignity of nature, which stamp the distinguishing differences betwixt
one man’s face and body and another’s.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If any thing is wanting to the conclusiveness of this testimony, it is
only to look at the pictures themselves; particularly the <cite>Miracle of
the Conversion</cite>, and the <cite>Assembly of Saints</cite>, which are little else than a
collection of divine portraits, in natural and expressive attitudes, full
of the loftiest thought and feeling, and as varied as they are fine. It
is this reliance on the power of nature which has produced those
masterpieces by the prince of painters, in which expression is all in
all;—where one spirit,—that of truth,—pervades every part, brings
down Heaven to Earth, mingles Cardinals and Popes with Angels and
Apostles,—and yet blends and harmonizes the whole by the true
touches and intense feeling of what is beautiful and grand in nature.
It is no wonder that Sir Joshua, when he first saw Raphael’s pictures
in the Vatican, was at a loss to discover any great excellence in them,
if he was looking out for his theory of the <em>ideal</em>,—of neutral character
and middle forms.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is more an appearance of abstract grandeur of form in
Michael Angelo. He has followed up, has enforced, and expanded,
as it were, a preconceived idea, till he sometimes seems to tread on
the verge of caricature. His forms, however, are not <em>middle</em>, but
<em>extreme</em> forms, massy, gigantic, supernatural. They convey the idea
of the greatest size and strength in the figure, and in all the parts of
the figure. Every muscle is swollen and turgid. This tendency to
exaggeration would have been avoided, if Michael Angelo had
recurred more constantly to nature, and had proceeded less on a
scientific knowledge of the structure of the human body; for science
gives only the positive form of the different parts, which the imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>may afterwards magnify, as it pleases, but it is nature alone
which combines them with perfect truth and delicacy, in all the
varieties of motion and expression. It is fortunate that we can refer,
in illustration of our doctrine, to the admirable fragment of the
Theseus at Lord Elgin’s, which shows the possibility of uniting the
grand and natural style in the highest degree. The form of the
limbs, as affected by pressure or action, and the general sway of the
body, are preserved with the most consummate mastery. We should
prefer this statue as a model for forming the style of the student to
the Apollo, which strikes us as having something of a theatrical
appearance, or to the Hercules, in which there is an ostentatious and
over-laboured display of anatomy. This last figure is so overloaded
with sinews, that it has been suggested as a doubt, whether, if life
could be put into it, it would be able to move. Grandeur of conception,
truth of nature, and purity of taste, seem to have been at
their height when the masterpieces which adorned the temple of
Minerva at Athens, of which we have only these imperfect fragments,
were produced. Compared with these, the later Greek statues
display a more elaborate workmanship, more of the artifices of style.
The several parts are more uniformly balanced, made more to tally
like modern periods: each muscle is more equally brought out, and
more highly finished as a part, but not with the same subordination of
each part to the whole. If some of these wonderful productions have
a fault, it is the want of that entire and naked simplicity which
pervades the whole of the <cite>Elgin marbles</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Works of the Grecian and Italian Artists.</span>—Having spoken
here of the Greek statues, and of the works of Raphael and Michael
Angelo, as far as relates to the imitation of nature, we shall
attempt to point out, to the best of our ability, and as concisely
as possible, what we conceive to be their general and characteristic
excellences. The ancients excelled in beauty of form; Michael
Angelo in grandeur of conception; Raphael in expression. In
Raphael’s faces, particularly his women, the expression is very
superior to the form; in the ancient statues the form is the principal
thing. The interest which the latter excite, is in a manner external;
it depends on a certain grace and lightness of appearance, joined with
exquisite symmetry and refined susceptibility to voluptuous emotions;
but there is in general a want of pathos. In their looks, we do not
read the workings of the heart; by their beauty they seem raised
above the sufferings of humanity, by their beauty they are deified.
The pathos which they exhibit is rather that of present and physical
distress, than of deep internal sentiment. What has been remarked
of Leonardo da Vinci, is also true of Raphael, that there is an angelic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>sweetness and tenderness in his faces, in which human frailty and
passion are purified by the sanctity of religion. The ancient statues
are finer objects for the eye to contemplate; they represent a more
perfect race of physical beings, but we have little sympathy with them.
In Raphael, all our natural sensibilities are heightened and refined by
the sentiments of faith and hope, pointing mysteriously to the interests
of another world. The same intensity of passion appears also to
distinguish Raphael from Michael Angelo. Michael Angelo’s forms
are grander, but they are not so informed with expression. Raphael’s,
however ordinary in themselves, are full of expression, ‘even to o’erflowing;’
every nerve and muscle is impregnated with feeling,—bursting
with meaning. In Michael Angelo, on the contrary, the
powers of body and mind appear superior to any events that can
happen to them; the capacity of thought and feeling is never full,
never strained or tasked to the extremity of what it will bear. All
is in a lofty repose and solitary grandeur, which no human interest
can shake or disturb. It has been said that Michael Angelo painted
<em>man</em>, and Raphael <em>men</em>; that the one was an epic, the other a dramatic
painter. But the distinction we have stated is, perhaps, truer and
more intelligible, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that the one gave greater dignity of form, and
the other greater force and refinement of expression. Michael
Angelo, in fact, borrowed his style from sculpture. He represented,
in general, only single figures (with subordinate accompaniments),
and had not to express the conflicting actions and passions of a
multitude of persons. It is therefore a mere truism to say that his
compositions are not dramatic. He is much more picturesque than
Raphael. The whole figure of his <cite>Jeremiah</cite> droops and hangs down
like a majestic tree surcharged with showers. His drawing of the
human form has the characteristic freedom and boldness of Titian’s
landscapes.</p>

<p class='c000'>After Michael Angelo and Raphael, there is no doubt that
Leonardo da Vinci, and Correggio, are the two painters, in modern
times, who have carried historical expression to the highest ideal
perfection; and yet it is equally certain that their heads are carefully
copied from faces and expressions in nature. Leonardo excelled
principally in his women and children. We find, in his female heads,
a peculiar charm of expression; a character of natural sweetness and
tender playfulness, mixed up with the pride of conscious intellect, and
the graceful reserve of personal dignity. He blends purity with
voluptuousness; and the expression of his women is equally characteristic
of ‘the mistress or the saint.’ His pictures are worked up to
the height of the idea he had conceived, with an elaborate, felicity;
but this idea was evidently first suggested, and afterwards religiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>compared with nature. This was his excellence. His fault is, that
his style of execution is too mathematical; that is, his pencil does not
follow the graceful variety of the details of objects, but substitutes
certain refined gradations, both of form and colour, producing equal
changes in equal distances, with a mechanical uniformity. Leonardo
was a man of profound learning as well as genius, and perhaps transferred
too much of the formality of science to his favourite art.</p>

<p class='c000'>The masterpieces of Correggio have the same identity with nature,
the same stamp of truth. He has indeed given to his pictures the
utmost softness and refinement of outline and expression; but this
idea, at which he constantly aimed, is filled up with all the details and
varieties which such heads would have in nature. So far from any
thing like a naked abstract idea, or middle form, the <em>individuality</em> of
his faces has something peculiar in it, even approaching the grotesque.
He has endeavoured to impress habitually on the countenance, those
undulating outlines which rapture or tenderness leave there, and has
chosen for this purpose those forms and proportions which most
obviously assisted his design.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the colouring of Correggio, it is nature itself. Not only the
general tone is perfectly true, but every speck and particle is varied
in colour, in relief, in texture, with a care, a felicity, and an effect,
which is almost magical. His light and shade are equally admirable.
No one else, perhaps, ever gave the same harmony and roundness to
his compositions. So true are his shadows,—equally free from
coldness, opacity, or false glare;—so clear, so broken, so airy, and
yet so deep, that if you hold your hand so as to cast a shadow on any
part of the flesh which is in the light, this part, so shaded, will
present exactly the same appearance which the painter has given to
the shadowed part of the picture. Correggio, indeed, possessed a
greater variety of excellences in the different departments of his art,
than any other painter; and yet it is remarkable, that the impression
which his pictures leave upon the mind of the common spectator, is
monotonous and comparatively feeble. His style is in some degree
mannered and confined. For instance, he is without the force,
passion, and grandeur of Raphael, who, however, possessed his
softness of expression, but of expression only; and in colour, in light
and shade, and other qualities, was quite inferior to Correggio. We
may, perhaps, solve this apparent contradiction by saying, that he
applied the power of his mind to a greater variety of objects than
others; but that this power was still of the same character; consisting
in a certain exquisite sense of the harmonious, the soft and graceful in
form, colour, and sentiment, but with a deficiency of strength, and a
tendency to effeminacy in all these.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>After the names of Raphael and Correggio, we shall mention that
of Guido, whose female faces are exceedingly beautiful and ideal, but
altogether commonplace and vapid, compared with those of Raphael
or Correggio; and they are so, for no other reason but that the
general idea they convey is not enriched and strengthened by an
intense contemplation of nature. For the same reason, we can
conceive nothing more unlike the antique than the figures of Nicholas
Poussin, except as to the preservation of the costume; and it is
perhaps chiefly owing to the habit of studying his art at second-hand,
or by means of scientific rules, that the great merits of that able
painter, whose understanding and genius are unquestionable, are
confined to his choice of subjects for his pictures, and his manner of
telling the story. His landscapes, which he probably took from
nature, are superior as paintings to his historical pieces. The faces of
Poussin want natural expression, as his figures want grace; but the
back grounds of his historical compositions can scarcely be surpassed.
In his plague of Athens, the very buildings seem stiff with horror.
His giants, seated on the top of their fabled mountains, and playing
on their Pan’s pipes, are as familiar and natural as if they were the
ordinary inhabitants of the scene. The finest of his landscapes is his
picture of the Deluge. The sun is just seen, wan and drooping in his
course. The sky is bowed down with a weight of waters, and Heaven
and earth seem mingling together.</p>

<p class='c000'>Titian is at the head of the Venetian school. He is the first of all
colourists. In delicacy and purity Correggio is equal to him, but his
colouring has not the same warmth and gusto in it. Titian’s flesh-colour
partakes of the glowing nature of the climate, and of the
luxuriousness of the manners of his country. He represents objects
not through a merely lucid medium, but as if tinged with a golden
light. Yet it is wonderful in how low a tone of local colouring his
pictures are painted,—how rigidly his means are husbanded. His
most gorgeous effects are produced, not less by keeping down, than by
heightening his colours; the fineness of his gradations adds to their
variety and force; and, with him, truth is the same thing as splendour.
Every thing is done by the severity of his eye, by the patience of his
touch. He is enabled to keep pace with nature, by never hurrying on
before her; and as he forms the broadest masses out of innumerable
varying parts and minute strokes of the pencil, so he unites and
harmonises the strongest contrasts by the most imperceptible
transitions. Every distinction is relieved and broken by some other
intermediate distinction, like half notes in music; and yet all this
accumulation of endless variety is so managed, as only to produce the
majestic simplicity of nature; so that to a common eye there is nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>extraordinary in his pictures, any more than in nature itself. It is,
we believe, owing to what has been here stated, that Titian is, of all
painters, at once the easiest and the most difficult to copy. He is
the most difficult to copy perfectly, for the artifice of his colouring
and execution is hid in its apparent simplicity; and yet the knowledge
of nature, and the arrangement of the forms and masses in his pictures,
is so masterly, that any copy made from them, even the rudest outline
or sketch, can hardly fail to have a look of high art. Because
he was the greatest colourist in the world, this, which was his most
prominent, has, for shortness, been considered as his only excellence;
and he has been said to have been ignorant of drawing. What he
was, generally speaking, deficient in, was invention or composition,
though even this appears to have been more from habit than want of
power; but his drawing of actual forms, where they were not to be
put into momentary action, or adapted to a particular expression, was
as fine as possible. His drawing of the forms of inanimate objects is
unrivalled. His trees have a marked character and physiognomy of
their own, and exhibit an appearance of strength or flexibility, solidity
or lightness, as if they were endued with conscious power and purpose.
Character was another excellence which Titian possessed in the
highest degree. It is scarcely speaking too highly of his portraits to
say, that they have as much expression, that is, convey as fine an idea
of intellect and feeling, as the historical heads of Raphael. The
chief difference appears to be, that the expression in Raphael is more
imaginary and contemplative, and in Titian more personal and constitutional.
The heads of the one seem thinking more of some event
or subject, those of the other to be thinking more of themselves. In
the portraits of Titian, as might be expected, the Italian character
always predominates; there is a look of piercing sagacity, of commanding
intellect, of acute sensibility, which it would be in vain to
seek for in any other portraits. The daring spirit and irritable
passions of the age and country, are distinctly stamped upon their
countenances, and can be as little mistaken as the costume which they
wear. The portraits of Raphael, though full of profound thought
and feeling, have more of common humanity about them. Titian’s
portraits are the most historical that ever were painted; and they are
so, for this reason, that they have most consistency of form and
expression. His portraits of Hippolito de Medici, and of a young
Neapolitan nobleman, lately in the gallery of the Louvre, are a
striking contrast in this respect. All the lines of the face in the one,
the eye-brows, the nose, the corners of the mouth, the contour of the
face, present the same sharp angles, the same acute, edgy, contracted,
violent expression. The other portrait has the finest expansion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>feature and outline, and conveys the most exquisite idea possible, of
mild, thoughtful sentiment. The consistency of the expression
constitutes as great a charm in Titian’s portraits, as the harmony of
the colouring. The similarity sometimes objected to his heads, is
partly national, and partly arises from the class of persons whom he
painted. He painted only Italians; and in his time it rarely
happened, that any but persons of the highest rank, Senators or
Cardinals, sat for their pictures. The similarity of costume of the
dress, the beard, &amp;c. also adds to the similarity of their appearance.
It adds, at the same time, to their picturesque effect; and the alteration
in this respect, is one circumstance among others that has been
injurious, not to say fatal, to modern art. This observation is not
confined to portrait; for the hired dresses with which our historical
painters clothe their figures sit no more easily on the imagination of
the artist, than they do gracefully on the lay-figures over which they
are thrown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Giorgioni, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, and the Bassans, are the
remaining great names of the Venetian school. The excellence of all
of them consisted in the bold, masterly, and striking imitation of
nature. Their want of <em>ideal form</em> and elevated character is, indeed, a
constant subject of reproach against them. Giorgioni takes the first
place among them; for he was in some measure the master of
Titian, whereas the others were only his disciples. The Carraccis,
Domenichino, and the rest of the Bolognese school, formed themselves
on a principle of combining the excellences of the Roman and
Venetian painters, in which they for a while succeeded to a considerable
degree; but they degenerated and dwindled away into
absolute insignificance, in proportion as they departed from nature, or
the great masters who had copied her, to mould their works on
academic rules, and the phantoms of abstract perfection.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Flemish and Dutch Painters.</span>—Rubens is the prince of the
Flemish painters. Of all the great painters, he is perhaps the
most artificial,—the one who painted most from his own imagination,—and,
what was almost the inevitable consequence, the most
of a mannerist. He had neither the Greek forms to study from,
nor the Roman expression, nor the high character, picturesque
costume, and sun-burnt hues which the Venetian painters had
immediately before them. He took, however, what circumstances
presented to him,—a fresher and more blooming tone of complexion,
arising from moister air, and a colder climate. To this
he added the congenial splendour of reflected lights and shadows
cast from rich drapery; and he made what amends he could for the
want of expression, by the richness of his compositions, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>fantastic variety of his allegorical groups. Both his colouring and his
drawing were, however, ideal exaggerations. But both had particular
qualities of the highest value. He has given to his flesh greater
transparency and freshness than any other painter; and this excellence
he had from nature. One of the finest instances will be found in his
<cite>Peasant Family going to Market</cite>, in which the figures have all the
bloom of health upon their countenances; and the very air of the
surrounding landscape strikes sharp and wholesome on the sense.
Rubens had another excellence; he has given all that relates to the
expression of motion in his allegorical figures, in his children, his
animals, even in his trees, to a degree which no one else has equalled,
or indeed approached. His drawing is often deficient in proportion,
in knowledge, and in elegance, but it is always picturesque. The
drawing of N. Poussin, on the contrary, which has been much cried
up, is merely learned and anatomical: he has a knowledge of the
structure and measurements of the human body, but very little feeling
of the grand, or beautiful, or striking, in form. All Rubens’s forms
have ease, freedom, and excessive elasticity. In the grotesque style
of history,—as in the groups of satyrs, nymphs, bacchanals, and
animals, where striking contrasts of form are combined with every
kind of rapid and irregular movement, he has not a rival. Witness
his Silenus at Blenheim, where the lines seem drunk and staggering;
and his procession of Cupids riding on animals at Whitehall, with
that adventurous leader of the infantine crew, who, with a spear, is
urging a lion, on which he is mounted, over the edge of the world;
for beyond we only see a precipice of clouds and sky. Rubens’s
power of expressing motion perhaps arose from the facility of his
pencil, and his habitually trusting a good deal to memory and imagination
in his compositions; for this quality can be given in no other
way. His portraits are the least valuable productions of his pencil.
His landscapes are often delightful, and appear like the work of fairy
hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>It remains to speak of Vandyke and Rembrandt, the one the
disciple of Rubens, the other the entire founder of his own school.
It is not possible for two painters to be more opposite. The
characteristic merits of the former are very happily summed up in
a single line of a poetical critic, where he speaks of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The soft precision of the clear Vandyke.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The general object of this analysis of the works of the great
masters, has been to show, that their pre-eminence has constantly
depended, not on the creation of a fantastic, abstract excellence,
existing nowhere but in their own minds, but in their selecting and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>embodying some one view of nature, which came immediately under
their habitual observation, and which their particular genius led them
to study and imitate with success. This is certainly the case with
Vandyke. His portraits, mostly of English women, in the collection
in the Louvre, have a cool refreshing air about them, a look of
simplicity and modesty even in the very tone, which forms a fine
contrast to the voluptuous glow and mellow golden lustre of Titian’s
Italian women. There is a quality of flesh-colour in Vandyke which
is to be found in no other painter, and which exactly conveys the
idea of the soft, smooth, sliding, continuous, delicately varied surface
of the skin. The objects in his pictures have the least possible
difference of light and shade, and are presented to the eye without
passing through any indirect medium. It is this extreme purity and
silvery clearness of tone, together with the facility and precision of
his particular forms, and a certain air of fashionable elegance,
characteristic of the age in which he flourished, that places Vandyke
in the first rank of portrait painters.</p>

<p class='c000'>If ever there was a man of genius in the art, it was Rembrandt.
He might be said to have created a medium of his own, through
which he saw all objects. He was the grossest and the least vulgar,
that is to say, the least common-place in his grossness, of all men.
He was the most downright, the least fastidious of the imitators of
nature. He took any object, he cared not what, how mean soever
in form, colour, and expression, and from the light and shade which
he threw upon it, it came out gorgeous from his hands. As Vandyke
made use of the smallest contrasts of light and shade, and painted as
if in the open air, Rembrandt used the most violent and abrupt
contrasts in this respect, and painted his objects as if in a dungeon.
His pictures may be said to be ‘bright with excessive darkness.’
His vision had acquired a lynx-eyed sharpness from the artificial
obscurity to which he had accustomed himself. ‘Mystery and
silence hung upon his pencil.’ Yet he could pass rapidly from one
extreme to another, and dip his colours with equal success in the
gloom of night, or in the blaze of the noon-day sun. In surrounding
different objects with a medium of imagination, solemn or dazzling,
he was a true poet; in all the rest, he was a mere painter, but a
painter of no common stamp. The powers of his hand were equal
to those of his eye; and indeed he could not have attempted the
subjects he did, without an execution as masterly as his knowledge
was profound. His colours are sometimes dropped in lumps on the
canvas; at other times they are laid on as smooth as glass; and he
not unfrequently painted with the handle of his brush. He had an
eye for all objects as far as he had seen them. His history and landscapes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>are equally fine in their way. His landscapes we could look
at for ever, though there is nothing in them. But ‘they are of the
earth, earthy.’ It seems as if he had dug them out of nature.
Every thing is so true, so real, so full of all the feelings and associations
which the eye can suggest to the other senses, that we
immediately take as strong an affection to them as if they were our
home—the very place where we were brought up. No length of
time could add to the intensity of the impression they convey.
Rembrandt is the least classical and the most romantic of all painters.
His Jacob’s Ladder is more like a dream than any other picture that
ever was painted. The figure of Jacob himself is thrown in one
corner of the picture like a bundle of clothes, while the angels hover
above the darkness, in the shape of airy wings.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be needless to prove that the generality of the Dutch
painters copied from actual objects. They have become almost a
bye-word for carrying this principle into its abuse, by copying every
thing they saw, and having no choice or preference of one thing to
another, unless that they preferred that which was most obvious and
common. We forgive them. They perhaps did better in faithfully
and skilfully imitating what they had seen, than in imagining what
they had not seen. Their pictures at least show, that there is nothing
in nature, however mean or trivial, that has not its beauty and some
interest belonging to it, if truly represented. We prefer Vangoyen’s
views on the borders of a canal, the yellow-tufted bank, and passing
sail, or Ruysdael’s woods and sparkling waterfalls, to the most
classical or epic compositions which they could have invented out of
nothing; and we think that Teniers’s boors, old women, and children,
are very superior to the little carved ivory Venuses in the pictures of
Vanderneer; just as we think Hogarth’s <cite>Marriage à la Mode</cite> is better
than his Sigismunda, or as Mr. Wilkie’s Card-Players is better than
his Alfred. We should not assuredly prefer a <cite>Dutch Fair</cite> by
Teniers to a <cite>Cartoon</cite> by Raphael; but we suspect we should prefer
a Dutch Fair by Teniers to a Cartoon by the same master; or we
should prefer truth and nature in the simplest dress, to affectation
and inanity in the most pompous disguise. Whatever is genuine in
art must proceed from the impulse of nature and individual genius.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>French and Spanish Painters.</span>—In the French school there are
but two names of high and established reputation, N. Poussin and
Claude Lorraine. Of the former we have already spoken; of the
latter we shall give our opinion when we come to speak of our own
Wilson. We ought not to pass over the names of Murillo and Velasquez,
those admirable Spanish painters. It is difficult to characterize
their peculiar excellences as distinct from those of the Italian and Dutch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>schools. They may be said to hold a middle rank between the
painters of mind and body. They express not so much thought and
sentiment, nor yet the mere exterior, as the life and spirit of the man.
Murillo is probably at the head of that class of painters who have
treated subjects of common life. After making the colours on the
canvass feel and think, the next best thing is to make them breathe and
live. But there is in Murillo’s pictures of this kind a look of real life,
a cordial flow of native animal spirits, which we find nowhere else.
We might here refer particularly to his picture of the <cite>Two Spanish
Beggar Boys</cite>, in the collection at Dulwich College, which cannot
easily be forgotten by those who have ever seen it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Progress of Art in Britain.</span>—We come now to speak of the
progress of art in our own Country,—of its present state,—and the
means proposed for advancing it to still higher perfection.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Hogarth.</span>—We shall speak first of Hogarth, both as he is the first
name in the order of time that we have to boast of, and as he is the
greatest comic painter of any age or country. His pictures are not
imitations of still life, or mere transcripts of incidental scenes or
customs; but powerful moral satires, exposing vice and folly in their
most ludicrous points of view, and with a profound insight into the weak
sides of character and manners, in all their tendencies, combinations,
and contrasts. There is not a single picture of his, containing a representation
of merely natural or domestic scenery. His object is not
so much ‘to hold the mirror up to nature,’ as ‘to show vice her own
feature, scorn her own image.’ Folly is there seen at the height—the
moon is at the full—it is the very error of the time. There is
a perpetual collision of eccentricities, a tilt and tournament of
absurdities, pampered into all sorts of affectation, airy, extravagant,
and ostentatious! Yet he is as little a caricaturist as he is a painter
of still life. Criticism has not done him justice, though public
opinion has. His works have received a sanction which it would be
vain to dispute, in the universal delight and admiration with which
they have been regarded, from their first appearance, to the present
moment. If the quantity of amusement, or of matter for reflection
which they have afforded, is that by which we are to judge of
precedence among the intellectual benefactors of mankind, there are
perhaps few persons who can put in a stronger claim to our gratitude
than Hogarth. The wonderful knowledge which he possessed of
human life and manners, is only to be surpassed (if it can be) by the
powers of invention with which he has arranged his materials, and
by the mastery of execution with which he has embodied and made
tangible the very thoughts and passing movements of the mind. Some
persons object to the style of Hogarth’s pictures, or the class to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>which they belong. First, Hogarth belongs to no class, or, if he
belongs to any, it is to the same class as Fielding, Smollett, Vanbrugh,
and Molière. Besides, the merit of his pictures does not depend on
the nature of his subjects, but on the knowledge displayed of them,
on the number of ideas, on the fund of observation and amusement
contained in them. Make what deductions you please for the
vulgarity of the subjects—yet in the research, the profundity, the
absolute truth and precision of the delineation of character,—in
the invention of incident, in wit and humour, in life and motion,
in everlasting variety and originality,—they never have, and probably
never will be, surpassed. They stimulate the faculties, as well as
amuse them. ‘Other pictures we see, Hogarth’s we read.’<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is one error which has been frequently entertained on this
subject, and which we wish to correct, namely, that Hogarth’s
genius was confined to the imitation of the coarse humours and broad
farce of the lowest life. But he excelled quite as much in exhibiting
the vices, the folly, and frivolity of the fashionable manners of his
time. His fine ladies do not yield the palm of ridicule to his waiting-maids,
and his lords and his porters are on a very respectable footing
of equality. He is quite at home, either in St. Giles’s or St. James’s.
There is no want, for example, in his <cite>Marriage à la Mode</cite>, or his
<cite>Taste in High Life</cite>, of affectation verging into idiotcy, or of languid
sensibility that might</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Die of a rose in aromatic pain.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Many of Hogarth’s characters would form admirable illustrations of
Pope’s Satires, who was contemporary with him. In short, Hogarth
was a painter of real, not of low life. He was, as we have said, a
satirist, and consequently his pencil did not dwell on the grand and
beautiful, but it glanced, with equal success at the absurdities and
peculiarities of high or low life, ‘of the great vulgar and the small.’</p>

<p class='c000'>To this it must be added, that he was as great a master of passion
as of humour. He succeeded in low tragedy, as much as in low or
genteel comedy, and had an absolute power in moving the affections
and rending the hearts of the spectators, by depicting the effects of
the most dreadful calamities of human life, on common minds and
common countenances. Of this, the <cite>Rake’s Progress</cite>, particularly the
Bedlam scene, and many others, are unanswerable proofs. Hogarth’s
merits, as a mere artist, are not confined to his prints. In general,
indeed, this is the case. But when he chose to take pains, he could
add the delicacies of execution and colouring in the highest degree to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>those of character and composition; as is evident in his series of
pictures, all equally well painted, of the <cite>Marriage à la Mode</cite>,
exhibited lately at the British Institution.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Wilson.</span>—We shall next speak of Wilson, whose pictures may be
divided into three classes:—his Italian landscapes, or imitations of the
manner of Claude,—his copies of English scenery,—and his historical
compositions. The first of these are, in our opinion, by much the
best; and we appeal, in support of this opinion, to the <cite>Apollo and the
Seasons</cite>, and to the <cite>Phaeton</cite>. The figures are of course out of the
question (these being as uncouth and slovenly as Claude’s are insipid and
finical); but the landscape, in both pictures, is delightful. In looking
at them, we breathe the air which the scene inspires, and feel the
genius of the place present to us. In the first, there is the cool
freshness of a misty spring morning; the sky, the water, the dim
horizon, all convey the same feeling. The fine grey tone, and varying
outline of the hills; the graceful form of the retiring lake, broken
still more by the hazy shadows of the objects that repose on its
bosom; the light trees that expand their branches in the air; and
the dark stone figure and mouldering temple, that contrast strongly
with the broad clear light of the rising day,—give a charm, a truth,
a force and harmony to this composition, which produce the greater
pleasure the longer it is dwelt on. The distribution of light and
shade resembles the effect of light on a globe. The <cite>Phaeton</cite> has the
dazzling fervid appearance of an autumnal evening; the golden
radiance streams in solid masses from behind the flickering clouds;
every object is baked in the sun;—the brown fore-ground, the thick
foliage of the trees, the streams, shrunk and stealing along behind the
dark high banks,—combine to produce that richness, and characteristic
unity of effect, which is to be found only in nature, or in art derived
from the study and imitation of nature. These two pictures, as they
have the greatest general effect, are also more carefully finished than
any other pictures we have seen of his.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, Wilson’s views of <em>English scenery</em> want almost every
thing that ought to recommend them. The subjects he has chosen
are not well fitted for the landscape-painter, and there is nothing in
the execution to redeem them. Ill-shaped mountains, or great heaps
of earth, trees that grow against them without character or elegance,
motionless waterfalls, a want of relief, of transparency and distance,
without the imposing grandeur of real magnitude (which it is
scarcely within the province of art to give),—are the chief features
and defects of this class of his pictures. In more confined scenes, the
effect must depend almost entirely on the difference in the execution
and the details; for the difference of colour alone is not sufficient to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>give relief to objects placed at a small distance from the eye. But, in
Wilson, there are commonly no details,—all is loose and general; and
this very circumstance, which might assist him in giving the massy
contrasts of light and shade, deprived his pencil of all force and precision
within a limited space. In general, air is necessary to the
landscape painter; and, for this reason, the lakes of Cumberland and
Westmoreland afford few subjects for landscape-painting. However
stupendous the scenery of that country is, and however powerful and
lasting the impression which it must always make on the imagination,
yet the effect is not produced merely through the medium of the eye,
but arises chiefly from collateral and associated feelings. There is
the knowledge of the physical magnitude of the objects in the midst
of which we are placed,—the slow, improgressive motion which we
make in traversing them;—there is the abrupt precipice, the torrent’s
roar, the boundless expanse of the prospect from the highest mountains,—the
difficulty of their ascent, their loneliness and silence; in short,
there is a constant sense and superstitious awe of the collective power
of matter, of the gigantic and eternal forms of nature, on which, from
the beginning of time, the hand of man has made no impression,
and which, by the lofty reflections they excite in us, give a sort
of intellectual sublimity even to our sense of physical weakness.
But there is little in all these circumstances that can be translated
into the <em>picturesque</em>, which makes its appeal immediately to the eye.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wilson’s historical landscapes, his <cite>Niobe</cite>, <cite>Celadon and Amelia</cite>, &amp;c.
do not, in our estimation, display either true taste or fine imagination,
but are affected and violent exaggerations of clumsy common nature.
They are made up mechanically of the same stock of materials,—an
over-hanging rock, bare shattered trees, black rolling clouds, and
forked lightning. The figures, in the most celebrated of these, are
not like the children of Niobe, punished by the Gods, but like a
group of rustics, crouching from a hail-storm. We agree with Sir
Joshua Reynolds, that Wilson’s mind was not, like N. Poussin’s,
sufficiently imbued with the knowledge of antiquity to transport the
imagination three thousand years back, to give natural objects a
sympathy with preternatural events, and to inform rocks, and trees,
and mountains with the presence of a God. To sum up his general
character, we may observe, that, besides his excellence in aërial perspective,
Wilson had great truth, harmony, and depth of local
colouring. He had a fine feeling of the proportions and conduct of
light and shade, and also an eye for graceful form, as far as regards
the bold and varying outlines of indefinite objects; as may be seen in
his foregrounds, &amp;c., where the artist is not tied down to an imitation
of characteristic and articulate forms. In his figures, trees, cattle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>and in everything having a determinate and regular form, his pencil
was not only deficient in accuracy of outline, but even in perspective
and actual relief. His trees, in particular, frequently seem pasted on
the canvass, like botanical specimens. In fine, we cannot subscribe to
the opinion of those who assert, that Wilson was superior to Claude as
a man of genius; nor can we discern any other grounds for this opinion,
than what would lead to the general conclusion,—that the more slovenly
the performance the finer the picture, and that that which is imperfect
is superior to that which is perfect. It might be said, on the same
principle, that the coarsest sign-painting is better than the reflection of
a landscape in a mirror; and the objection that is sometimes made to
the mere imitation of nature, cannot be made to the landscapes of
Claude, for in them the Graces themselves have, with their own hands,
assisted in selecting and disposing every object. Is the general effect in
<em>his</em> pictures injured by the details? Is the truth inconsistent with the
beauty of the imitation? Does the perpetual profusion of objects and
scenery, all perfect in themselves, interfere with the simple grandeur
and comprehensive magnificence of the whole? Does the precision
with which a plant is marked in the fore-ground, take away from the
air-drawn distinctions of the blue glimmering horizon? Is there any
want of that endless airy space, where the eye wanders at liberty
under the open sky, explores distant objects, and returns back as
from a delightful journey? There is no comparison between Claude
and Wilson. Sir Joshua Reynolds used to say, that there would
be another Raphael before there would be another Claude. His
landscapes have all that is exquisite and refined in art and nature.
Every thing is moulded into grace and harmony; and, at the touch
of his pencil, shepherds with their flocks, temples and groves, and
winding glades, and scattered hamlets, rise up in never-ending
succession, under the azure sky and the resplendent sun, while</p>

<p class='c000'>What landscape-painter does not feel this of Claude.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Gainsborough.</span>—We have heard an anecdote connected with the
reputation of Gainsborough’s pictures, which rests on pretty good
authority. Sir Joshua Reynolds, at one of the Academy dinners,
speaking of Gainsborough, said to a friend,—‘He is undoubtedly
the best English landscape-painter.’ ‘No,’ said Wilson, who
overheard the conversation, ‘he is not the best landscape-painter,
but he is the best portrait-painter in England.’ They were both
wrong; but the story is creditable to the versatility of Gainsborough’s
talents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those of his portraits which we have seen are not in the first rank.
They are in a good measure imitations of Vandyke; and have more
an air of gentility, than of nature. His landscapes are of two classes
or periods; his early and his later pictures. The former are minute
imitations of nature, or of painters who imitated nature, such as
Ruysdael, &amp;c. some of which have great truth and clearness. His
later pictures are flimsy caricatures of Rubens, who himself carried
inattention to the details to the utmost limit that it would bear.
Many of Gainsborough’s latter landscapes may be compared to bad
water-colour drawings, washed in by mechanical movements of the
hand, without any communication with the eye. The truth seems to
be, that Gainsborough found there was something wanting in his
<em>early manner</em>, that is, something beyond the literal imitation of the
details of natural objects; and he appears to have concluded rather
hastily, that the way to arrive at that <em>something more</em>, was to discard
truth and nature altogether. His fame rests principally, at present,
on his fancy-pieces, cottage-children, shepherd-boys, &amp;c. These
have often great truth, great sweetness, and the subjects are often
chosen with great felicity. We too often find, however, even in his
happiest efforts, a consciousness in the turn of the limbs, and a pensive
languor in the expression, which is not taken from nature. We think
the gloss of art is never so ill bestowed as on such subjects, the
essence of which is simplicity. It is perhaps the general fault of
Gainsborough, that he presents us with an ideal common life, of which
we have had a surfeit in poetry and romance. His subjects are
softened, and sentimentalised too much; it is not simple unaffected
nature that we see, but nature sitting for her picture. Our artist, we
suspect, led the way to that masquerade style, which piques itself on
giving the air of an Adonis to the driver of a hay-cart, and models
the features of a milk-maid on the principles of the antique. His
<cite>Woodman’s Head</cite> is admirable. Nor can too much praise be given to
his <cite>Shepherd Boy in a Storm</cite>; in which the unconscious simplicity of
the boy’s expression, looking up with his hands folded and with timid
wonder,—the noisy chattering of a magpie perched above,—and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>rustling of the coming storm in the branches of the trees, produce a
most delightful and romantic impression on the mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gainsborough was to be considered, perhaps, rather as a man of
delicate taste, and of an elegant and feeling mind, than as a man
of genius; as a lover of the art, rather than an artist. He devoted
himself to it, with a view to amuse and soothe his mind, with the ease
of a gentleman, not with the severity of a professional student. He
wished to make his pictures, like himself, amiable; but a too constant
desire to please almost unavoidably leads to affectation and effeminacy.
He wanted that vigour of intellect, which perceives the beauty of
truth; and thought that painting was to be gained, like other
mistresses, by flattery and smiles. It was an error which we are
disposed to forgive in one, around whose memory, both as an artist
and a man, many fond recollections, many vain regrets, must always
linger.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Sir Joshua Reynolds.</span>—The authority of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
both from his example and instructions, has had, and still continues
to have, a considerable influence on the state of art in this country.
That influence has been on the whole unquestionably beneficial in
itself, as well as highly creditable to the rare talents and elegant
mind of Sir Joshua; for it has raised the art of painting from the
lowest state of degradation,—of dry, meagre, lifeless inanity, to
something at least respectable, and bearing an affinity to the rough
strength and bold spirit of the national character. Whether the same
implicit deference to his authority, which has helped to advance the
art thus far, may not, among other causes, limit and retard its future
progress? Whether there are not certain original errors, both in his
principles and practice, which, the farther they are proceeded in, the
farther they will lead us from the truth? Whether there is not a
systematic bias from the right line by which alone we can arrive
at the goal of the highest perfection?—are questions well worth
considering.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall begin with Sir Joshua’s merits as an artist. There is
one error which we wish to correct at setting out, because we think
it important. There is not a greater or more unaccountable mistake
than the supposition that Sir Joshua Reynolds owed his success or
excellence in his profession, to his having been the first who introduced
into this country more general principles of the art, and who
raised portrait to the dignity of history from the low drudgery
of copying the peculiarities, meannesses, and details of individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>nature, which was all that had been attempted by his immediate predecessors.
This is so far from being true, that the very reverse is
the fact. If Sir Joshua did not give these details and peculiarities so
much as might be wished, those who went before him did not give
them at all. Those pretended general principles of the art, which,
it is said, ‘alone give value and dignity to it,’ had been pushed to
their extremest absurdity before his time; and it was in getting rid
of the mechanical systematic monotony and <em>middle forms</em>, by the help
of which Lely, Kneller, Hudson, the French painters, and others,
carried on their manufactories of history and face painting, and in
returning (as far as he did return) to the truth and force of individual
nature, that the secret both of his fame and fortune lay. The
pedantic, servile race of artists, whom Reynolds superseded, had
carried the abstract principle of improving on nature to such a degree
of refinement, that they left it out altogether; and confounded all the
varieties and irregularities of form, feature, character, expression or
attitude, in the same artificial mould of fancied grace and fashionable
insipidity. The portraits of Kneller, for example, seem all to have
been turned in a machine; the eye-brows are arched as if by a
compass; the mouth curled, and the chin dimpled, the head turned
on one side, and the hands placed in the same affected position. The
portraits of this mannerist, therefore, are as like one another as the
dresses which were then in fashion; and have the same ‘dignity and
value’ as the full bottomed wigs which graced their originals. The
superiority of Reynolds consisted in his being varied and natural,
instead of being artificial and uniform. The spirit, grace, or dignity
which he added to his portraits, he borrowed from nature, and not
from the ambiguous quackery of rules. His feeling of truth and
nature was too strong to permit him to adopt the unmeaning style of
Kneller and Hudson; but his logical acuteness was not such as to
enable him to detect the verbal fallacies and speculative absurdities
which he had learned from Richardson and Coypel; and, from some
defects in his own practice, he was led to confound negligence with
grandeur. But of this hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Joseph Reynolds owed his vast superiority over his contemporaries
to incessant practice, and habitual attention to nature,
to quick organic sensibility, to considerable power of observation,
and still greater taste in perceiving and availing himself of those
excellences of others, which lay within his own walk of art. We
can by no means look upon Sir Joshua as having a claim to the
first rank of genius. He would hardly have been a great painter, if
other greater painters had not lived before him. He would not
have given a first impulse to the art, nor did he advance any part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>of it beyond the point where he found it. He did not present any
new view of nature, nor is he to be placed in the same class with
those who did. Even in colour, his pallet was spread for him by
the old Masters, and his eye imbibed its full perception of depth
and harmony of tone, from the Dutch and Venetian schools, rather
than from nature. His early pictures are poor and flimsy. He
indeed learned to see the finer qualities of nature through the works
of art, which he, perhaps, might never have discovered in nature
itself. He became rich by the accumulation of borrowed wealth,
and his genius was the offspring of taste. He combined and applied
the materials of others to his own purpose, with admirable success;
he was an industrious compiler, or skilful translator, not an original
inventor in art. The art would remain, in all its essential elements,
just where it is, if Sir Joshua had never lived. He has supplied the
industry of future plagiarists with no new materials. But it has been
well observed, that the value of every work of art, as well as the
genius of the artist, depends, not more on the degree of excellence,
than on the degree of originality displayed in it. Sir Joshua, however,
was perhaps the most original imitator that ever appeared in the
world; and the reason of this, in a great measure, was, that he was
compelled to combine what he saw in art, with what he saw in
nature, which was constantly before him. The portrait-painter is,
in this respect, much less liable than the historical painter, to deviate
into the extremes of manner and affectation; for he cannot discard
nature altogether, under the excuse that <em>she only puts him out</em>. He
must meet her, face to face; and if he is not incorrigible, he will
see something there that cannot fail to be of service to him.
Another circumstance which must have been favourable to Sir Joshua
was, that though not the originator <em>in point of time</em>, he was the first
Englishman who transplanted the higher excellences of his profession
into his own country, and had the merit, if not of an inventor,
of a reformer of the art. His mode of painting had the graces of
novelty in the age and country in which he lived; and he had,
therefore, all the stimulus to exertion, which arose from the
enthusiastic applause of his contemporaries, and from a desire to
expand and refine the taste of the public.</p>

<p class='c000'>To an eye for colour and for effects of light and shade, Sir
Joshua united a strong perception of individual character,—a lively
feeling of the quaint and grotesque in expression, and great mastery
of execution. He had comparatively little knowledge of drawing,
either as it regarded proportion or form. The beauty of some of
his female faces and figures arises almost entirely from their softness
and fleshiness. His pencil wanted firmness and precision. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>expression, even of his best portraits, seldom implies either lofty or
impassioned intellect or delicate sensibility. He also wanted grace,
if grace requires simplicity. The mere negation of stiffness and
formality is not grace; for looseness and distortion are not grace.
His favourite attitudes are not easy and natural, but the affectation
of ease and nature. They are violent deviations from a right line.
Many of the figures in his fancy-pieces are placed in postures in
which they could not remain for an instant without extreme
difficulty and awkwardness. We might instance the <cite>Girl drawing
with a Pencil</cite>, and some others. His portraits are his best pictures,
and of these his portraits of men are the best; his pictures of
children are the next in value. He had fine subjects for the
former, from the masculine sense and originality of character of
many of the persons whom he painted; and he had also a great
advantage (as far as practice went) in painting a number of persons
of every rank and description. Some of the finest and most
interesting are those of Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith (which is, however,
too much a mere sketch), Baretti, Dr. Burney, John Hunter,
and the inimitable portrait of Bishop Newton. The elegant
simplicity of character, expression, and drawing, preserved throughout
the last picture, even to the attitude and mode of handling,
discover the true genius of a painter. We also remember to have
seen a print of Thomas Warton, than which nothing could be more
characteristic or more natural. These were all Reynolds’s intimate
acquaintances, and it could not be said of them that they were men
of ‘no mark or likelihood.’ Their traits had probably sunk deep
into the artist’s mind; he painted them as pure studies from nature,
copying the real image existing before him, with all its known
characteristic peculiarities; and, with as much wisdom as good-nature,
sacrificing the graces on the altar of friendship. They are
downright portraits, and nothing more, and they are valuable in
proportion. In his portraits of women, on the contrary (with very
few exceptions), Sir Joshua appears to have consulted either the
vanity of his employers or his own fanciful theory. They have not
the look of individual nature, nor have they, to compensate the want
of this, either peculiar elegance of form, refinement of expression,
delicacy of complexion, or gracefulness of manner. Vandyke’s
attitudes have been complained of as stiff and confined. Reynolds,
to avoid this defect, has fallen into the contrary extreme of negligence
and contortion. His female figures which aim at gentility,
are twisted into that serpentine line, the idea of which he ridiculed
so much in Hogarth. Indeed, Sir Joshua, in his <cite>Discourses</cite> (see his
account of Correggio), speaks of grace as if it were nearly allied to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>affectation. Grace signifies that which is pleasing and natural in the
posture and motions of the human form, as Beauty is more properly
applied to the form itself. That which is stiff, inanimate, and
without motion, cannot, therefore, be graceful; but, to suppose that
a figure, to be graceful, need only be put into some languishing or
extravagant posture, is to mistake flutter and affectation for ease and
elegance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Joshua’s children, as we have said above, are among his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef
d’œuvres</span></i>. The faces of children have in general that want of
precision of outline, that prominence of relief, and strong contrast of
colour, which were peculiarly adapted to his style of painting. The
arch simplicity of expression, and the grotesque character which he
has given to the heads of his children, were, however, borrowed
from Correggio. His Puck is the most masterly of all these; and
the colouring, execution, and character, alike exquisite. The single
figure of the Infant Hercules is also admirable. Many of those to
which his friends have suggested historical titles are mere common
portraits or casual studies. Thus the Infant Samuel is an innocent
little child saying its prayers at the bed’s feet: it has nothing to do
with the story of the Hebrew prophet. The same objection will
apply to many of his fancy-pieces and historical compositions.
There is often no connection between the picture and the subject but
the name. Even his celebrated Iphigenia (beautiful as she is, and
prodigal of her charms) does not answer to the idea of the story.
In drawing the naked figure, Sir Joshua’s want of truth and firmness
of outline, became more apparent; and his mode of laying on his
colours, which, in the face and extremities, was relieved and broken
by the abrupt inequalities of surface and variety of tints in each part,
produced a degree of heaviness and opacity in the larger masses of
flesh-colour, which can indeed only be avoided by extreme delicacy,
or extreme lightness of execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shall we speak the truth at once? In our opinion, Sir Joshua
did not possess either that high imagination, or those strong feelings,
without which no painter can become a poet in his art. His larger
historical compositions have been generally allowed to be most liable
to objection, in a critical point of view. We shall not attempt to
judge them by scientific or technical rules, but make one or two
observations on the character and feeling displayed in them. The
highest subject which Sir Joshua has attempted was the <cite>Count
Ugolino</cite>, and it was, as might be expected from the circumstances,
a total failure. He had, it seems, painted a study of an old beggar-man’s
head; and some person, who must have known as little of
painting as of poetry, persuaded the unsuspecting artist, that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>the exact expression of Dante’s Count Ugolino, one of the most
grand, terrific, and appalling characters in modern fiction. Reynolds,
who knew nothing of the matter but what he was told, took his good
fortune for granted, and only extended his canvass to admit the rest
of the figures. The attitude and expression of Count Ugolino
himself, are what the artist intended them to be, till they were
pampered into something else by the officious vanity of friends—those
of a common mendicant at the corner of a street, waiting
patiently for some charitable donation. The imagination of the
painter took refuge in a parish work-house, instead of ascending the
steps of the Tower of Famine. The hero of Dante is a lofty,
high-minded, and unprincipled Italian nobleman, who had betrayed
his country to the enemy, and who, as a punishment for his crime,
is shut up with his four sons in the dungeon of the citadel, where he
shortly finds the doors barred against him, and food withheld.
He in vain watches with eager feverish eye the opening of the door
at the accustomed hour, and his looks turn to stone; his children
one by one drop down dead at his feet; he is seized with blindness,
and, in the agony of his despair, he gropes on his knees after them,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Calling each by name</div>
      <div class='line'>For three days after they were dead.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Even in the other world, he is represented with the same fierce,
dauntless, unrelenting character, ‘gnawing the skull of his adversary,
his fell repast.’ The subject of the <cite>Laocoon</cite> is scarcely equal to that
described by Dante. The horror <em>there</em> is physical and momentary;
in the other, the imagination fills up the long, obscure, dreary void
of despair, and joins its unutterable pangs to the loud cries of nature.
What is there in the picture to convey the ghastly horrors of the
scene, or the mighty energy of soul with which they are borne?<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a>
His picture of <cite>Macbeth</cite> is full of wild and grotesque images; and the
apparatus of the witches contains a very elaborate and well arranged
inventory of dreadful objects. His Cardinal Beaufort is a fine
display of rich mellow colouring; and there is something gentlemanly
and Shakespearian in the King and the attendant Nobleman. At the
same time, we think the expression of the Cardinal himself is too
much one of physical horror, a canine gnashing of the teeth, like a
man strangled. This is not the best style of history. Mrs. Siddons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>as the <cite>Tragic Muse</cite>, is neither the tragic muse nor Mrs. Siddons;
and we have still stronger objections to <cite>Garrick between Tragedy and
Comedy</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a striking similarity between Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
theory and his practice; and as each of these has been appealed to in
support of the other, it is necessary that we should examine both.
Sir Joshua’s practice was generally confined to the illustration of that
part of his theory, which relates to the more immediate imitation of
nature, and it is to what he says on this subject, that we shall chiefly
direct our observations at present.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lays it down as a general and invariable rule, that ‘<em>the great
style in art, and the most</em> <span class='fss'>PERFECT IMITATION OF NATURE</span>, <em>consists in
avoiding the details and peculiarities of particular objects</em>.’ This
sweeping principle he applies almost indiscriminately to <cite>Portrait</cite>,
<cite>History</cite>, and <cite>Landscape</cite>; and he appears to have been led to the
conclusion itself, from supposing the imitation of particulars to be
inconsistent with general truth and effect. It appears to us, that the
highest perfection of the art depends, not on separating but on
uniting general truth and effect with individual distinctness and
accuracy.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>First</em>, it is said, that the great style in painting, as it relates to the
immediate imitation of external nature, consists in avoiding the
details of particular objects. It consists neither in giving nor avoiding
them, but in something quite different from both. Any one may
avoid the details. So far, there is no difference between the <cite>Cartoons</cite>,
and a common sign-painting. Greatness consists in giving the larger
masses and proportions with truth;—this does not prevent giving the
smaller ones too. The utmost grandeur of outline, and the broadest
masses of light and shade, are perfectly compatible with the utmost
minuteness and delicacy of detail, as may be seen in nature. It is
not, indeed, common to see both qualities combined in the imitations
of nature, any more than the combination of other excellences; nor
are we here saying to which the principal attention of the artist
should be directed; but we deny, that, considered in themselves,
the absence of the one quality is necessary or sufficient to the
production of the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, for example, the form of the eye-brow is correctly given, it
will be perfectly indifferent to the truth or grandeur of the design,
whether it consists of one broad mark, or is composed of a number
of hair-lines, arranged in the same order. So, if the lights and shades
are disposed in fine and large masses, the <em>breadth</em> of the picture, as
it is called, cannot possibly be affected by the filling up of those
masses with the details, that is, with the subordinate distinctions which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>appear in nature. The anatomical details in Michael Angelo, the
ever-varying outline of Raphael, the perfect execution of the Greek
statues, do not destroy their symmetry or dignity of form; and, in
the finest specimens of the composition of colour, we may observe the
largest masses combined with the greatest variety in the parts of
which those masses are composed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>gross</em> style consists in giving no details; the <em>finical</em> in giving
nothing else. Nature contains both large and small parts, both
masses and details; and the same may be said of the most perfect
works of art. The union of both kinds of excellence, of strength
with delicacy, as far as the limits of human capacity, and the shortness
of human life would permit, is that which has established the reputation
of the most successful imitators of nature. Farther, their most
finished works are their best. The predominance, indeed, of either
excellence in the best Masters, has varied according to their opinion
of the relative value of these qualities,—the labour they had the time
or the patience to bestow on their works,—the skill of the artist,—or
the nature and extent of his subject. But, if the rule here objected
to (that the careful imitation of the parts injures the effect of the
whole), be once admitted, slovenliness would become another name
for genius, and the most unfinished performance be the best. That
such has been the confused impression left on the mind by the perusal
of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s Discourses, is evident from the practice, as
well as conversation, of many (even eminent) artists. The late Mr.
Opie proceeded entirely on this principle. He left many admirable
studies of portraits, particularly in what relates to the disposition and
effect of light and shade; but he never finished any of the parts,
thinking them beneath the attention of a great artist. He went
over the whole head the second day as he had done the first, and
therefore made no progress. The picture at last, having neither the
lightness of a sketch, nor the accuracy of a finished work, looked
coarse, laboured, and heavy. Titian is the most perfect example of
high finishing. In him the details are engrafted on the most profound
knowledge of effect, and attention to the character of what he
represented. His pictures have the exact look of nature, the very
tone and texture of flesh. The variety of his tints is blended into
the greatest simplicity. There is a proper degree both of solidity and
transparency. All the parts hang together; every stroke tells, and
adds to the effect of the rest. Sir Joshua seems to deny that Titian
finished much; and says that he produced, by two or three strokes of
his pencil, effects which the most laborious copyist would in vain
attempt to equal. It is true, he availed himself in some degree of
what is called <em>execution</em>, to facilitate his imitation of the details and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>peculiarities of nature; but it was to facilitate, not to supersede it.
There can be nothing more distinct than execution and daubing.
Titian, however, made a very moderate, though a very admirable,
use of this power; and those who copy his pictures will find that the
simplicity is in the results, not in the details. To conclude our
observations on this head, we will only add, that, while the artist
thinks there is any thing to be done, either to the whole or to the
parts of his picture, which can give it still more the look of nature,
if he is willing to proceed, we would not advise him to desist. This
rule is the more necessary to the young student, for he will relax in
his attention as he grows older. And again, with respect to the
subordinate parts of a picture, there is no danger that he will bestow
a disproportionate degree of labour upon them, because he will not
feel the same interest in copying them, and because a much less
degree of accuracy will serve every purpose of deception.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Secondly</em>, with regard to the imitation of expression, we can hardly
agree with Sir Joshua, that ‘the perfection of portrait-painting consists
in giving the general idea or character without the individual peculiarities.’
No doubt, if we were to choose between the general character,
and the peculiarities of feature, we ought to prefer the former. But,
they are so far from being incompatible with, that they are not without
some difficulty distinguishable from, each other. There is a general
look of the face, a predominant expression arising from the correspondence
and connection of the different parts, which it is of the
first and last importance to give; and without which, no elaboration
of detached parts, or marking of the peculiarities of single features,
is worth any thing; but which, at the same time, is not destroyed,
but assisted by the careful finishing, and still more by giving the
exact outline of each part.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is on this point that the modern French and English schools
differ, and (in our opinion) are both wrong. The English seem
generally to suppose, that if they only leave out the subordinate
parts, they are sure of the general result. The French, on the
contrary, as erroneously imagine, that, by attending successively to
each separate part, they must infallibly arrive at a correct whole;
not considering that, besides the parts, there is their relation to each
other, and the general expression stamped upon them by the character
of the individual, which to be seen must be felt; for it is demonstrable,
that all character and expression, to be adequately represented, must
be perceived by the mind, and not by the eye only. The French
painters give only lines and precise differences; the English only
general masses, and strong effects. Hence the two nations reproach
one another with the difference of their styles of art,—the one as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>dry, hard, and minute,—the other as gross, gothic, and unfinished;
and they will probably remain for ever satisfied with each other’s
defects, as they afford a very tolerable fund of consolation on either
side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much has been said of <em>historical portrait</em>; and we have no objection
to this phrase, if properly understood. The giving historical truth
to a portrait, means, then, the representing the individual under one
consistent, probable, and striking view; or showing the different
features, muscles, &amp;c. in one action, and modified by one principle.
A portrait thus painted may be said to be <em>historical</em>; that is, it carries
internal evidence of truth and propriety with it; and the number of
individual peculiarities, as long as they are true to nature, cannot lessen,
but must add to the strength of the general impression.</p>

<p class='c000'>It might be shown (if there were room in this place) that Sir
Joshua has constructed his theory of the <em>ideal</em> in art, upon the same
mistaken principle of the negation or abstraction of <em>particular nature</em>.
The <em>ideal</em> is not a negative but a positive thing. The leaving out
the details or peculiarities of an individual face does not make it one
jot more ideal. To paint history, is to paint nature as answering to
a general, predominant, or preconceived idea in the mind, of strength,
beauty, action, passion, thought, &amp;c.; but the way to do this is not
to leave out the details, but to incorporate the general idea with the
details;—that is, to show the same expression actuating and modifying
every movement of the muscles, and the same character preserved
consistently through every part of the body. Grandeur does not
consist in omitting the parts, but in connecting all the parts into
a whole, and in giving their combined and varied action: abstract
truth or ideal perfection does not consist in rejecting the peculiarities
of form, but in rejecting all those which are not consistent with the
character intended to be given; and in following up the same <em>general
idea</em> of softness, voluptuousness, strength, activity, or any combination
of these through every ramification of the frame. But these modifications
of form or expression can only be learnt from nature, and therefore
the perfection of art must always be sought in nature. The
ideal properly applies as much to the <em>idea</em> of ugliness, weakness, folly,
meanness, vice, as of beauty, strength, wisdom, magnanimity, or
virtue. The antique heads of fauns and satyrs, of Pan or Silenus,
are quite as ideal as those of the Apollo or Bacchus; and Hogarth
adhered to an idea of humour in his faces, as Raphael did to an
idea of sentiment. But Raphael found the character of sentiment
in nature as much as Hogarth did that of humour; otherwise neither
of them would have given one or the other with such perfect truth,
purity, force, and keeping. Sir Joshua Reynolds’s <em>ideal</em>, as consisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>in a mere negation of individuality, bears just the same relation to real
beauty or grandeur as caricature does to true comic character.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Present State of British Art.</span>—It is owing either to a mistaken
theory of elevated art, or to the want of models in nature, that the
English are hitherto without any painter of serious historical subjects,
who can be placed in the first rank of genius. Many of the pictures
of modern artists have shown a capacity for correct and happy delineation
of actual objects and domestic incidents, only inferior to the masterpieces
of the Dutch School. We might here mention the names of
Wilkie, Collins, Heaphy, and many others. We have portrait-painters,
who have attained to a very high degree of excellence in all the
branches of their art. In landscape, Turner has shown a knowledge
of the effects of air, and of powerful relief in objects, which was never
surpassed. But in the highest walk of art—in giving the movements
of the finer or loftier passions of the mind, this country has not
produced a single painter, who has made even a faint approach to the
excellence of the great Italian painters. We have, indeed, a good
number of specimens of the clay-figure, the anatomical mechanism,
the regular proportions measured by a two-foot rule;—large canvasses,
covered with stiff figures, arranged in deliberate order, with the
characters and story correctly expressed by uplifted eyes or hands,
according to old receipt-books for the passions;—and with all the
hardness and inflexibility of figures carved in wood, and painted over
in good strong body colours, that look ‘as if some of nature’s
journeymen had made them, and not made them well.’ But we
still want a Prometheus to give life to the cumbrous mass, to throw
an intellectual light over the opaque image,—to embody the inmost
refinements of thought to the outward eye,—to lay bare the very
soul of passion. That picture is of little comparative value which
can be completely <em>translated</em> into another language,—of which the
description in a common catalogue conveys all that is expressed by
the picture itself; for it is the excellence of every art to give what
can be given by no other, in the same degree. Much less is that
picture to be esteemed, which only injures and defaces the idea
already existing in the mind’s eye,—which does not come up to
the conception which the imagination forms of the subject, and
substitutes a dull reality for high sentiment; for the art is in this
case an incumbrance, not an assistance, and interferes with, instead
of adding to, the stock of our pleasurable sensations. But we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>be at a loss to point out (we will not say any English picture, but
certainly) any English painter, who, in heroic and classical composition,
has risen to the height of his subject, and answered the expectation
of the well-informed spectator, or excited the same impression by
visible means, as had been excited by words, or by reflection.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> That
this inferiority in English art is not owing to a deficiency of genius,
imagination, or passion, is proved sufficiently by the works of our
poets and dramatic writers, which, in loftiness and force, are not
surpassed by those of any other nation. But whatever may be the
depth of internal thought and feeling in the English character, it
seems to be <em>more internal</em>; and (whether this is owing to habit, or
physical constitution) to have, comparatively, a less immediate and
powerful communication with the organic expression of passion,—which
exhibits the thoughts and feelings in the countenance, and
furnishes matter for the historic muse of painting. The English
artist is instantly sensible that the flutter, grimace, and extravagance
of the French physiognomy, are incompatible with high history; and
we are at no loss to explain in this way, that is, from the defect of
living models, how it is that the productions of the French school
are marked with all the affectation of national caricature, or sink into
tame and lifeless imitations of the antique. May we not account
satisfactorily for the general defects of our own historic productions,
in a similar way,—from a certain inertness and constitutional phlegm,
which does not habitually impress the workings of the mind in
correspondent traces on the countenance, and which may also render
us less sensible of these outward and visible signs of passion, even
when they are so impressed there? The irregularity of proportion,
and want of symmetry, in the structure of the national features,
though it certainly enhances the difficulty of infusing natural grace
and grandeur into the works of art, rather accounts for our not
having been able to attain the exquisite refinements of Grecian
sculpture, than for our not having rivalled the Italian painters in
expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. West does not form an exception to, but a confirmation of,
these general observations. His pictures have all that can be required
in what relates to the composition of the subject; to the regular
arrangement of the groups; the anatomical proportions of the human
body; and the technical knowledge of expression,—as far as expression
is reducible to abstract rules, and is merely a vehicle for the
telling of a story; so that anger, wonder, sorrow, pity, &amp;c. have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>each their appropriate and well-known designations. These, however,
are but the instrumental parts of the art, the means, not the end; but
beyond these, Mr. West’s pictures do not go. They never ‘snatch
a grace beyond the reach of art.’ They exhibit the <em>mask</em>, not the
<em>soul</em> of expression. We doubt, whether, in the entire range of Mr.
West’s productions, meritorious and admirable as the design and
composition often are, there is to be found one truly fine head. They
display a total want of gusto. In Raphael, the same divine spirit
breathes through every part; it either agitates the inmost frame, or
plays in gentle undulations on the trembling surface. Whether we
see his figures bending with all the blandishments of maternal love,
or standing in the motionless silence of thought, or hurried into the
tumult of action, the whole is under the impulse of deep passion.
But Mr. West sees hardly any thing in the human face but bones
and cartilages; or, if he avails himself of the more flexible
machinery of nerves and muscles, it is only by rule and method.
The effect is not that which the soul of passion impresses on the
countenance, and which the soul of genius alone can seize; but such
as might, in a good measure, be given to wooden puppets or pasteboard
figures, pulled by wires, and taught to open the mouth, or
knit the forehead, or raise the eyes in a very scientific manner. In
fact, there is no want of art or learning in his pictures, but of nature
and feeling.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Means of Promoting the Fine Arts.</span>—It is not long ago that
an opinion was very general, that all that was wanting to the highest
splendour and perfection of the arts in this country might be supplied
by Academies and public institutions. We believe the most sanguine
promoters of this scheme have at present relaxed in their zeal. There
are <em>three</em> ways in which Academies and public institutions may be
supposed to promote the fine arts; either by furnishing the best
models to the student; or by holding out immediate emolument and
patronage; or by improving the public taste. We shall bestow a
short consideration on the influence of each.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, a constant reference to the best models of art necessarily
tends to enervate the mind, to intercept our view of nature, and to
distract the attention by a variety of unattainable excellence. An
intimate acquaintance with the works of the celebrated masters may
indeed add to the indolent refinements of taste, but will never
produce one work of original genius, one great artist. In proof of
the general truth of this observation, we might cite the history of
the progress and decay of art in all countries where it has flourished.
It is a little extraordinary, that if the real sources of perfection are to
be sought in Schools, in Models, and Public Institutions, that whereever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>schools, models, and public institutions have existed, there the
arts should regularly disappear,—that the effect should never follow
from the cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Greek statues remain to this day unrivalled,—the undisputed
standard of the most perfect symmetry of form. In Italy the art of
painting has had the same fate. After its long and painful struggles
in the time of the earlier artists, Cimabue, Ghirlandaio, Massacio,
and others, it burst out with a light almost too dazzling to behold,
in the works of Titian, Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Correggio;
which was reflected, with diminished lustre, in the productions of their
immediate disciples; lingered for a while with the school of the
Carraccis, and expired with Guido Reni. From that period, painting
sunk to so low a state in Italy as to excite only pity or contempt.
There is not a single name to redeem its faded glory from utter
oblivion. Yet this has not been owing to any want of Dilettanti and
Della Cruscan societies,—of academies of Florence, of Bologna, of
Parma, and Pisa,—of honorary members and Foreign Correspondents—of
pupils and teachers, professors and patrons, and the whole busy
tribe of critics and connoisseurs.</p>

<p class='c000'>What is become of the successors of Rubens, Rembrandt, and
Vandyke? What have the French Academicians done for the arts;
or what will they ever do, but add intolerable affectation and grimace
to centos of heads from the antique, and caricature Greek forms by
putting them into opera attitudes? Nicholas Poussin is the only
example on record in favour of the contrary theory, and we have
already sufficiently noticed his defects. What extraordinary advances
have we made in our own country in consequence of the establishment
of the Royal Academy? What greater names has the English
school to boast than those of Hogarth, Reynolds, and Wilson, who
created it? Even the venerable President of the Royal Academy
was one of its founders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, we might cite, in support of our assertion, the works of
Carlo Maratti, of Raphael Mengs, or of any of the effeminate school
of critics and copyists, who have attempted to blend the borrowed
beauties of others in a perfect whole. What do they contain, but
a negation of every excellence which they pretend to combine? The
assiduous imitator, in his attempts to grasp all, loses his hold of that
which was placed within his reach, and, from aspiring at universal
excellence, sinks into uniform mediocrity. The student who has
models of every kind of excellence constantly before him, is not
only diverted from that particular walk of art, in which, by patient
exertion, he might have obtained ultimate success, but, from having
his imagination habitually raised to an overstrained standard of refinement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>by the sight of the most exquisite examples in art, he becomes
impatient and dissatisfied with his own attempts, determines to reach
the same perfection all at once, or throws down his pencil in despair.
Thus the young enthusiast, whose genius and energy were to rival
the great Masters of antiquity, or create a new æra in the art itself,
baffled in his first sanguine expectations, reposes in indolence on what
others have done; wonders how such perfection could have been
achieved,—grows familiar with the minutest peculiarities of the
different schools,—flutters between the splendour of Rubens, and
the grace of Raphael, and ends in nothing. Such was not Correggio.
He saw and felt for himself; he was of no school, but had his own
world of art to create. That image of truth and beauty, which
existed in his mind, he was forced to construct for himself, without
rules or models. As it had arisen in his mind from the contemplation
of nature, so he could only hope to embody it to others, by the
imitation of nature. We can conceive the work growing under his
hands by slow and patient touches, approaching nearer to perfection,
softened into finer grace, gaining strength from delicacy, and at last
reflecting the pure image of nature on the canvass. Such is always
the true progress of art; such are the necessary means by which the
greatest works of every kind have been produced. They have been
the effect of power gathering strength from exercise, and warmth
from its own impulse—stimulated to fresh efforts by conscious success,
and by the surprise and strangeness of a new world of beauty, opening
to the delighted imagination. The triumphs of art were victories
over the difficulties of art; the prodigies of genius, the result of that
strength which had grappled with nature. Titian copied even a
plant or a piece of common drapery from the objects themselves;
and Raphael is known to have made elaborate studies of the principal
heads in his pictures. All the great painters of this period were
thoroughly grounded in the first principles of their art; had learned
to copy a face, a hand, or an eye, and had acquired patience to finish
a single figure, before they undertook to paint extensive compositions.
They knew that though Fame is represented with her head above the
clouds, her feet rest upon the earth. Genius can only have its full
scope, where, though much may have been done, more remains to do;
where models exist chiefly to show the deficiencies of art, and where
the perfect idea is left to be filled up in the painter’s imagination.
When once the stimulus of novelty and of original exertion is wanting,
generations repose on what has been done for them by their
predecessors, as individuals, after a certain period, rest satisfied with
the knowledge they have already acquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the pecuniary advantages arising from the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>patronage of the arts;—the plan unfortunately defeats itself; for it
multiplies its objects faster than it can satisfy their claims; and raises
up a swarm of competitors for the prize of genius from the dregs of
idleness and dulness. The real patron is anxious to reward merit,
not to encourage gratuitous pretensions to it; to see that the man of
genius <em>takes no detriment</em>, that another Wilson is not left to perish for
want;—not to propagate the breed of embryo candidates for fame.
Offers of public and promiscuous patronage can in general be little
better than a species of intellectual seduction, administering provocatives
to vanity and avarice, and leading astray the youth of the nation
by fallacious hopes, which can scarcely ever be realized. At the
same time, the good that might be done by private taste and
benevolence, is in a great measure defeated. The moment that a
few individuals of discernment and liberal spirit become members of
a public body, they are no longer anything more than parts of a
machine, which is usually wielded at will by some officious, overweening
pretender; their good-sense and good-nature are lost in a
mass of ignorance and presumption; their names only serve to reflect
credit on proceedings in which they have no share, and which are
determined on by a majority of persons who have no interest in the
arts but what arises from the importance attached to them by regular
organization, and no opinions but what are dictated to them by some
self-constituted judge. As far as we have had an opportunity of
observing the conduct of such bodies of men, instead of taking the
lead of public opinion, of giving a firm, manly, and independent tone
to that opinion, they make it their business to watch all its caprices,
and follow it in every casual turning. They dare not give their
sanction to sterling merit, struggling with difficulties, but take
advantage of its success, to reflect credit on their own reputation for
sagacity. Their taste is a servile dependant on their vanity, and
their patronage has an air of pauperism about it. Perhaps the only
public patronage which was ever really useful to the arts, or worthy
of them, was that which they received first in Greece, and afterwards
in Italy, from the religious institutions of the country; when the
artist felt himself, as it were, a servant at the altar; when his hand
gave a visible form to Gods or Heroes, Angels or Apostles; and when
the enthusiasm of genius was exalted by mingling with the flame of
national devotion. The artist was not here degraded, by being made
the dependant on the caprice of wealth or fashion, but felt himself at
once the servant and the benefactor of the public. He had to embody,
by the highest efforts of his art, subjects which were sacred to the
imagination and feelings of the spectators; there was a common link,
a mutual sympathy between them in their common faith. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>other mode of patronage, but that which arises, either from the
general institutions and manners of a people, or from the real unaffected
taste of individuals, must, we conceive, be illegitimate,
corrupted in its source, and either ineffectual or injurious to its
professed object.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lastly, Academies and Institutions may be supposed to assist the
progress of the fine arts, by promoting a wider taste for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general, it must happen in the first stages of the arts, that as
none but those who had a natural genius for them would attempt to
practise them,—so none but those who had a natural taste for them,
would pretend to judge of or criticise them. This must be an incalculable
advantage to the man of true genius; for it is no other
than the privilege of being tried by his peers. In an age when
connoisseurship had not become a fashion; when religion, war, and
intrigue, occupied the time and thoughts of the great, only those
minds of superior refinement would be led to notice the works of art,
who had a real sense of their excellence; and, in giving way to the
powerful bent of his own genius, the painter was most likely to consult
the taste of his judges. He had not to deal with pretenders to taste,
through vanity, affectation, and idleness. He had to appeal to the
higher faculties of the soul,—to that deep and innate sensibility to
truth and beauty, which required only fit objects to have its enthusiasm
excited,—and to that independent strength of mind, which, in the
midst of ignorance and barbarism, hailed and fostered genius whereever
it met with it. Titian was patronised by Charles <span class='fss'>V.</span> Count
Castiglione was the friend of Raphael. These were true patrons and
true critics; and, as there were no others (for the world, in general,
merely looked on and wondered), there can be little doubt that such
a period of dearth of factitious patronage would be most favourable
to the full developement of the greatest talents, and to the attainment
of the highest excellence.</p>

<p class='c000'>By means of public institutions, the number of candidates for fame,
and pretenders to criticism, is increased beyond all calculation, while
the quantity of genius and feeling remain much the same as before;
with these disadvantages, that the man of original genius is often lost
among the crowd of competitors who would never have become such,
but from encouragement and example, and that the voice of the few
whom nature intended for judges, is apt to be drowned in the noisy
and forward suffrages of shallow smatterers in Taste.</p>

  <h3 class='c003'>JAMES BARRY</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Barry (James) an eminent painter, was born in Cork, in Ireland,
October 11, 1741. His father had been a builder, and at one time
of his life, a coasting trader between the two countries of England
and Ireland. To this business of a trader was James destined, and he
actually made, when a boy, several voyages; but these voyages being
forced upon him, he on one occasion ran away from the ship, and on
others discovered such an aversion to the life and habits of a sailor,
as to induce his father to quit all hopes of him in this line, and to
suffer him to pursue his inclinations, which led him to drawing and
study. When on board his father’s vessel, instead of handling sails
and ropes, and climbing the mast, he was generally occupied with a
piece of black chalk, sketching the coast, or drawing figures, as his
fancy directed him. When his father found that the idea of making
a sailor of him must be given up, he permitted him to acquire as
much instruction as the schools of Cork afforded; but long retained
his aversion to the chalk drawings, with which the floors and walls
of the house were covered; the boy being always engaged in some
attempt at large figures, and early catching at the means of representing
action, attitude, and passion. It was at a very early period of
his life that some bookseller in Ireland, undertaking to reprint a set
of fables or emblems, young Barry offered to furnish the drawings,
and, as it is believed, helped to etch the engravings, such as they
were. At the schools in Cork, which he was sent to, he was distinguished
by his parts and industry above his school-fellows; his
habits differed from those of ordinary boys, as he seldom mixed in
their games or amusements, but at those times stole off to his own
room, where he worked at his pencil, or was studying some book
that he had borrowed or bought. He would spend whole nights in
this manner at his studies, to the alarm of his mother, who dreaded
his injuring his health or setting fire to the house, and who often
kept up his sister or the servant to watch him. His allowance of
money he spent in buying books or candles to read by; he sometimes
locked himself up in his room for days, and seldom slept upon his
bed, or else made it so hard as to take away the temptation or luxury
of lying long in it. Perhaps the unsocial and ascetic turn of his
temper, which thus early manifested itself, might be remarked as the
source both of the misfortunes of his life, and the defects of his
genius. Common humanity, a sense of pleasure, and a sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>with the feelings of those around us, is not more necessary to success
in life, than it probably is to success in the fine arts. Few things can
be more fatal to the artist than this sort of indifference to the common
pleasures and pursuits of life. If affected, it is bad; if real and
constitutional, it is even worse. It stuck to poor Barry to the last.
It is not to be understood that, at this period of his life, he led the
life of an absolute recluse, for he could and did occasionally join in
any feats going on in the neighbourhood, and was not behind other
boys in such pastimes and mischief as boys are usually fond of. An
adventure which happened to him about this time, and which left a
strong impression on his mind, is worth mentioning here. In one of
his rambles in the neighbourhood, he entered, one winter’s evening,
an old, and, as he thought, an uninhabited house, situate in a narrow
bye-lane in the city of Cork. The house was without doors or
windows; but curiosity impelled him to enter, and, after mounting a
rotten staircase, which conducted to empty rooms on different floors,
he arrived at the garret, where he could just discern, by the glimmering
light of a few embers, two old and emaciated figures, broken by
age, disease, and want, sitting beside each other, in the act, as far as
their palsied efforts would permit, of tearing each other’s faces; not
a word being uttered by either, but with the most horrible grimaces
that malice could invent. They took no notice of his entrance, but
went on with their deeds of mutual hate, which made such an
impression on the boy that he ran down stairs, making his own
reflections, which he afterwards found verified through life, that man
and all animals are malicious and cruel in proportion as they are
impotent; and that age and poverty, two of the worst evils in human
life, almost always add to the calamities inherent in them by arts of
their own creating. In general, his great desire to improve his mind
led him to seek the society of educated men; who were not averse to
receive him, seeing his active and inquisitive disposition, and his
seriousness of manner, couched under a garb the plainest and coarsest;
for he adopted this kind of attire from his childhood, not from
affectation, but from an indifference to all dress. Having a retentive
memory, he profited by his own reading, and by the conversation of
others, who directed him also in the choice of books. As his
finances were too low to make many purchases, he borrowed books
from his friends, and was in the practice of making large extracts
from such as he particularly liked, and sometimes even of copying
out the whole book, of which several specimens were found among
his papers, written in a stiff school-boy’s hand. As his industry was
excessive, his advances in the acquisition of knowledge were rapid,
and he was regarded as a prodigy by his school-fellows. His mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>being a zealous Catholic, the son could not avoid mixing at times in
the company of priests resident at Cork, who pointed out to him
books of polemical divinity, of which he became a great reader, and
for which he retained a strong bias during his lifetime. He was said
at one time to have been destined for the priesthood, but for this
report there is no authority. He, however, always continued a
Catholic, and in the decline of life manifested rather a bigoted
attachment to the religion of his early choice. For a short interval
he had a little wavering in his belief of revealed religion in general;
but a conversation with Mr. Edmund Burke put an end to this
levity. A book which Mr. Burke lent him, and which settled his
mind on this subject, was Bishop Butler’s <cite>Analogy</cite>; and, as a suitable
reward, he has placed this Prelate in the group of divines, in his
picture of Elysium.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the age of seventeen he first attempted oil paintings; and
between that and the age of twenty-two, when he first went to Dublin,
he produced several large ones, which decorated his father’s house,
and represented subjects not often handled by young men; such as
Æneas escaping with his family from the flames of Troy; Susanna
and the Elders; Daniel in the Lion’s Den, &amp;c. At this period, he
also produced the picture which first drew him into public notice,
launched him on an ampler theatre than his native town of Cork
afforded, and, above all, gained him the acquaintance and patronage
of Mr. Burke. This picture was founded on an old tradition of the
landing of St. Patrick on the sea-coast of Cashel, and of the conversion
and baptism of the king of that district by the patron saint of
Ireland. The priest, in the act of baptizing his new convert,
inadvertently strikes the spear of the crosier in the foot of the
monarch. The holy father, absorbed in the duties of his office, does
not perceive what he has done, and the king, without interrupting
the ceremony, bears the pain with immoveable fortitude. This
incident, together with the gestures and expressions of the attendants,
certainly formed a good subject for an historical picture; and Mr.
Barry’s manner of treating it was such as to insure him the applause
and admiration of the connoisseurs of the metropolis of the sister
kingdom, where it was exhibited in 1762 or 1763. Mr. Barry took
this picture with him to Dublin; and afterwards going to the exhibition
room, being delighted with the encomiums it received from the
spectators, he could not refrain from making himself known as the
painter. His pretensions were treated with great contempt by the
company, and Barry burst into tears of anger and vexation. But the
incredulity of his hearers was a compliment paid to the real or
supposed excellence of his painting. It appears that a Dr. Sleigh, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>physician of Cork, and a sensible and amiable man, was first instrumental
in introducing young Barry to the notice of Mr. Burke. During their
early acquaintance, having fallen into a dispute on the subject of taste,
Barry quoted a passage in support of his opinion from the <cite>Essay on the
Sublime and Beautiful</cite>, which had been just then published anonymously,
and which Barry, in his youthful admiration of it, had, it seems,
transcribed entire. Burke affected to treat this work as a theoretical
romance, of no authority whatever, which threw Barry into such a
rage in its defence, that Mr. Burke thought it necessary to appease
him by owning himself to be the author. The scene ended in
Barry’s running to embrace him, and showing him the copy of the
work which he had been at the pains to transcribe. He passed his
time in Dublin in reading, drawing, and society. While he resided
here, an anecdote is preserved of him, which marks the character of
the man. He had been enticed by his companions several times to
carousings at a tavern, and one night, as he wandered home by
himself, a thought struck him of the frivolity and viciousness of thus
mis-spending his time: the fault, he imagined, lay in his money, and,
therefore, without more ado, in order to avoid the morrow’s temptation,
he threw the whole of his wealth, which perhaps amounted to
no great sum, into the Liffey, and locked himself up at his favourite
pursuits. After a residence of seven or eight months in Dublin, an
opportunity offered of accompanying some part of Mr. Burke’s family
to London, which he eagerly embraced. This took place some time
in the year 1764, when he was twenty-three years of age, and with
one of those advantages which do not always fall to the lot of young
artists on their arrival in the British capital, that of being recommended
to the acquaintance of the most eminent men in the profession
by the persuasive eloquence of a man who, to genius in himself, added
the rare and noble quality of encouraging it in others; this was Mr.
Burke, who lost no time, not merely in making Barry known, but in
procuring for him the first of all objects to an inexperienced and
destitute young artist, employment. This employment was chiefly
that of copying in oil drawings by Mr. Stewart, better known by the
name of Athenian Stewart; and whether it suited the ambition of
Barry or not, to be at this kind of labour, yet there can be no doubt
that he profited by his connection with such a man as Stewart, and
had full leisure to cast his eye about, and to improve by the general
aspect of art and artists that occupied the period.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Burke and his other friends thinking it important that he
should be introduced to a wider and nobler school of art than this
country afforded, now came forward with the means necessary to
accomplish this object; and in the latter end of 1765 Mr. Barry proceeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>to the Continent, where he remained till the beginning of
1771, studying his art with an enthusiasm which seemed to augur the
highest success, and making observations on the different <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvres</span></i>
of Italy with equal independence of judgment and nicety of discrimination.
He was supported during this period by the friendly
liberality of the Burke family (Edmund, William, and Richard),
who allowed him forty pounds a-year for his necessary expenditure,
besides occasional remittances for particular purposes. He proceeded
first to Paris, then to Rome, where he remained upwards of three
years, from thence to Florence and Bologna, and home through
Venice. His letters to the Burkes, giving an account of Michael
Angelo, Raphael, Titian, and Leonardo da Vinci, show a complete
insight into the characteristic merits of their works, and would make
us wonder (if the case were at all singular) how he could enter with
such force, delicacy, and feeling, into excellencies of which he never
transplanted an atom into his own works. He saw, felt, and <em>wrote</em>;
his impressions were profound and refined, but the expression of them
must be instantaneous, such as gave the results of them with a stroke
of the pen, as they were received by a glance of the eye, and he
could not wait for the slow process of the pencil for embodying his
conceptions in the necessary details of his own art. It was his desire
to make the ideas and language of painting co-instantaneous,—to
express abstract results by abstract mechanical means (a thing impossible),—to
stamp the idea in his mind at once upon the canvass,
without knowledge of its parts, without labour, without patience,
without a moment’s time or thought intervening between what he
wished to do and its being done, that was perhaps the principal
obstacle to his ever attaining a degree of excellence in his profession
at all proportioned either to his ambition or his genius. It is probable,
that, as his hand had not the patience to give the details of objects,
his eye, from the same habit of mind, had not the power to analyze
them. It is possible, however, to see the results without the same
laborious process that is necessary to convey them; for the eye sees
faster than the hand can move.</p>

<p class='c000'>We suspect Mr. Barry did not succeed very well in copying the
pictures he so well describes; because he appears to have copied but
few, only one of Raphael, as far as we can find, and three from
Titian, whom he justly considered as the model of colouring, and as
more perfect in that department of the art than either Raphael or
Michael Angelo were in theirs, expression and form, the highest
excellence in which he conceives to have been possessed only by the
ancients. In copying from the antique, however, he manifested the
same aversion to labour, or to that kind of labour which, by showing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>us our defects, compels us to make exertions to remedy them. He
made all his drawings from the antique, by means of a <em>delineator</em>, that
is, a mechanical instrument, to save the trouble of acquiring a knowledge
both of form and proportion. In this manner, equally gratifying
to his indolence and his self-love, he is stated to have made numberless
sketches of the antique statues, of all sizes, and in all directions,
carefully noting down on his sketch-paper their several measurements
and proportions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The consequences are before us in his pictures; namely, that all
those of his figures which he took from these memorandums are
deficient in every thing but form, and that all the others are equally
deficient in form and every thing else. If he did not employ his
pencil properly, or enough, in copying from the models he saw, he
employed his thoughts and his pen about them with indefatigable zeal
and spirit. He talked well about them; he wrote well about them;
he made researches into all the collateral branches of art and knowledge,
sculpture, architecture, cameos, seals, and intaglios. There is
a long letter of his, addressed to Mr. Burke, on the origin of the
Gothic style of architecture, written, as it should seem, to convince
his friend and patron of his industry in neglecting his proper business.
Soon after his arrival at Rome, he became embroiled with the whole
tribe of connoisseurs, painters, and patrons there, whether native or
foreign, on subjects of <em>virtù</em>; and he continued in this state of hostility
with those around him while he staid there, and, indeed, to the end
of his life. One might be tempted to suppose that Barry chiefly
studied his art as a subject to employ his dialectics upon. On this
unfortunate disposition of his to wrangling and controversy, as it was
likely to affect his progress in his art and his progress in life, he
received some most judicious advice from Sir Joshua Reynolds and
Mr. Burke, his answers to which show an admirable self-ignorance.
On his irritable denunciations of the practices and tricks of the
Italian picture-dealers, Mr. Burke makes a reflection well deserving
of attention. ‘In particular, you may be assured that the traffic in
antiquity, and all the enthusiasm, folly, and fraud, which may be in
it, <em>never did, nor never can, hurt the merit of living artists</em>. Quite the
contrary, in my opinion: for I have ever observed, that, whatever it
be that turns the minds of men to anything relative to the arts, even
the most remotely so, brings artists more and more into credit and
repute; and though, now and then, the mere broker and dealer in
such things runs away with a great deal of profit, yet, in the end,
ingenious men will find themselves gainers by the dispositions which
are nourished and diffused in the world by such pursuits.’ Mr. Barry
painted two pictures while abroad, his Adam and Eve and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Philoctetes. The first of these he sent home as a specimen of his
progress in the art. It does not appear to have given much satisfaction.
His Philoctetes he brought home with him. It is a most
wretched, coarse, unclassical performance, the direct opposite of all
that he thought it to be. During his stay at Rome, he made an
excursion to Naples, and was highly delighted with the collections of
art there. All the time he was abroad, Mr. Burke and his brothers
not only were punctual in their remittances to him, but kept up a
most friendly and cordial correspondence. On one occasion, owing
to the delay of a letter, a bill which Barry had presented to a banker
was dishonoured. This detained Barry for some time at the place
where he was in very awkward circumstances, and he had thoughts
of getting rid of his chagrin and of his prospects in life at once, by
running away and turning friar. For some time previous to his
return to England, Mr. Hamilton (afterwards Sir William) appears
to have been almost the only person with whom he kept up any
intimacy. It was on his return home through Milan that he witnessed,
and has recorded with due reprobation, the destruction of Leonardo’s
Last Supper, which two bungling artists were employed to paint over
by order of one Count de Firmian, the secretary of state.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1771, Mr. Barry arrived in England, after an
absence of five years. He soon after produced his picture of Venus,
which has been compared to the Galatea of Raphael, the Venus of
Titian, and the Venus of Medicis, without reason. Mr. Barry
flattered himself that he had surpassed the famous statue of that
name, by avoiding the appearance of <em>maternity</em> in it. There is an
engraving of it by Mr. Valentine Green. In 1773, he exhibited his
Jupiter and Juno on Mount Ida, which was much praised by some
critics of that day. His Death of General Wolfe was considered as
a falling off from his great style of art, which consisted in painting
Greek subjects, and it accordingly is said to ‘have obtained no
praise.’ His fondness for Greek costume was assigned by his
admirers as the cause of his reluctance to paint portraits; as if the
coat was of more importance than the face. His fastidiousness, in
this respect, and his frequent excuses, or blunt refusals, to go on with
a portrait of Mr. Burke, which he had begun, caused a misunderstanding
with that gentleman, which does not appear to have been
ever entirely made up. The difference between them is said to have
been widened by Burke’s growing intimacy with Sir Joshua, and by
Barry’s feeling some little jealousy of the fame and fortune of his
rival <em>in an humbler walk of the art</em>. He, about the same time, painted
a pair of classical subjects, Mercury inventing the Lyre, and Narcissus
looking at himself in the water, the last suggested to him by Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>Burke. He also painted an historical picture of Chiron and Achilles,
and another of the story of Stratonice, for which last the Duke of
Richmond gave him a hundred guineas. In 1773, there was a plan
in contemplation for our artists to decorate the inside of St. Paul’s
with historical and sacred subjects; but this plan fell to the ground,
from its not meeting with the concurrence of the Bishop of London
and the Archbishop of Canterbury, to the no small mortification of
Barry, who had fixed upon the subject he was to paint,—the rejection
of Christ by the Jews when Pilate proposes his release. In 1775, he
published <cite>An Inquiry into the real and imaginary Obstructions to the Acquisition
of the Arts in England</cite>, vindicating the capacity of the English for
the fine arts, and tracing their slow progress hitherto to the Reformation;
to political and civil dissensions; and, lastly, to the general turn
of the public mind to mechanics, manufactures, and commerce. In
the year 1774, shortly after the failure of the scheme of decorating
St. Paul’s, a proposal was made, through Mr. Valentine Green, to the
same artists, Reynolds, West, Cipriani, Barry, &amp;c. for ornamenting the
great room of the Society for the <cite>Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures,
and Commerce</cite>, in the Adelphi, with historical and allegorical paintings.
This proposal was at the time rejected by the artists themselves;
but, in 1777, Mr. Barry made an offer to paint the whole
himself, on condition of being allowed the choice of his subjects, and
being paid the expense of canvass, paints, and models, by the Society.
This offer was accepted, and he finished the series of pictures at the
end of seven years, instead of two, which he had proposed to himself,
but with entire satisfaction to the members of the Society, for whom
it was intended, and who conducted themselves to him with liberality
throughout. They granted him two exhibitions, and at different
periods voted him 50 guineas, their gold medal, and again 200
guineas, and a seat among them. Dr. Johnson remarked, when he
saw the pictures, that, ‘whatever the hand had done, the head had
done its part.’ There was an excellent anonymous criticism, supposed
to be by Mr. Burke, published on them, in answer to some remarks
put forth by Barry, in his descriptive catalogue, on the <em>ideal</em> style of
art, and the necessity of size to grandeur. His notions on both these
subjects are very ably controverted, and, indeed, they are the rock on
which Barry’s genius split. It would be curious if Mr. Burke were
the author of these strictures; for it is not improbable that Barry was
led into the last error, here deprecated, by that author’s <cite>Essay on the
Sublime and Beautiful</cite>. The series consists of six pictures, showing
the progress of human culture. The first represents Orpheus taming
the savages by his lyre. The figure of Orpheus himself is more
like a drunken bacchanal than an inspired poet or lawgiver. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>only part of this picture which is valuable is the background, in one
part of which a lion is seen ready to dart upon a family group milking
near a cave, and, in another, a tyger is pursuing a horse. There is
certainly a scope of thought and picturesque invention, in thus showing
indirectly the protection which civilization extends, as it were,
over both man and animals. The second picture is a Grecian harvest,
which has nothing Grecian in it. But we cannot apply this censure
to the third picture of the Olympic Games, some of the figures in
which, and the principal group, are exceedingly graceful, classical,
and finely conceived. This picture is the only proof Mr. Barry has
left upon canvass that he was not utterly insensible to the beauties of
the art. The figure of the young man on horseback really reminds
the spectator of some of the Elgin marbles; and the outlines of the
two youthful victors at the games, supporting their father on their
shoulders, are excellent. The colouring is, however, as bald and
wretched in this picture as the rest, and there is a great want of
expression. The fourth picture is the triumph of commerce, with
Dr. Burney swimming in the Thames, with his hair powdered,
among naked sea-nymphs. The fifth, the Society of Arts, distributing
their annual prizes. And the sixth represents Elysium. This last
picture is a collection of caricatured portraits of celebrated individuals
of all ages and nations, strangely jumbled together, with a huge
allegorical figure of Retribution driving Heresy, Vice, and Atheism,
into the infernal regions. The moral design of all these pictures is
much better explained in the catalogue than on the canvass; and the
artist has added none of the graces of the pencil to it in any of them,
with the exception above made. Mr. Barry appears, however, to
have rested his pretensions to fame as an artist on this work, for he
did little afterwards but paltry engravings from himself, and the
enormous and totally worthless picture of Pandora in the assembly of
the gods. His self-denial, frugality, and fortitude, in the prosecution
of his work at the Adelphi, cannot be too much applauded. He has
been heard to say, that at the time of his undertaking it, he had only
16s. in his pocket; and that he had often been obliged, after painting
all day, to sit up at night to sketch or engrave some design for the
printsellers, which was to supply him with his next day’s subsistence.
In this manner he did his prints of Job, dedicated to Mr. Burke, of
the birth of Venus, Polemon, Head of Chatham, King Lear, from
the picture painted for the Shakespear gallery, &amp;c. His prints are
caricatures even of his pictures: they seem engraved on rotten
wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after Mr. Barry’s return from the Continent, he was chosen
a member of the Royal Academy; and in 1782, was appointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>professor of painting, in the room of Mr. Penny, with a salary of
£30 a-year. The lectures which he delivered from the chair were
full of strong sense, and strong advice, both to the students and
academicians. Among other things, he insisted much on the necessity
of purchasing a collection of pictures by the best masters as models
for the students, and proposed several of those in the Orleans collection.
This recommendation was not relished by the academicians,
who, perhaps, thought their own pictures the best models for their
several pupils. Bickerings, jealousies, and quarrels arose, and at
length reached such a height, that, in 1799, Mr. Barry was expelled
from the academy, soon after the appearance of his <cite>Letter to the
Dilettanti Society</cite>; a very amusing, but eccentric publication, full of
the highest enthusiasm for his art, and the lowest contempt for the
living professors of it. In 1800, he undertook a design or drawing to
celebrate the union of the two kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland.
The profits of the two exhibitions of the Adelphi pictures are said to
have amounted to above £500. Lord Romney presented him with
100 guineas for his portrait, which had been copied into one of the
pictures, and he had twenty guineas for a head of Mr. Hooper. He
probably received other sums for portraits introduced into the work.
By extreme frugality he contrived, not only to live, but to save
money. His house was twice robbed of sums which he kept by him;
one of the times (in 1794) of upwards of £100; a loss which was
made up by the munificence of Lord Radnor, and by that of his
friends, the Hollis’s. After the loss of his salary, a subscription was
set on foot by the Earl of Buchan to relieve him from his difficulties,
and to settle him in a larger house to finish his picture of Pandora.
The subscription amounted to £1000, with which an annuity was
bought; but of this he was prevented from enjoying the benefit; for,
on the 6th of February 1806, he was seized with a pleuritic fever,
and as he neglected medical assistance at first, it was afterwards of no
use. After lingering on for a fortnight in considerable pain, but
without losing his fortitude of mind, he died on the 22d of the same
month. On the 13th of March, the body was taken to the great
room of the Society of Arts, and was thence attended, the following
day, by a numerous and respectable train of his friends to the cathedral
of St. Paul’s, where it was deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Barry, as an artist, a writer, and a man, was distinguished by
great inequality of powers and extreme contradictions in character.
He was gross and refined at the same time; violent and urbane;
sociable and sullen; inflammable and inert; ardent and phlegmatic;
relapsing from enthusiasm into indolence; irritable, headstrong, impatient
of restraint; captious in his intercourse with his friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>wavering and desultory in his profession. In his personal habits he
was careless of appearances or decency, penurious, slovenly, and
squalid. He regarded nothing but his immediate impulses, confirmed
into incorrigible habits. His pencil was under no control. His eye
and his hand seemed to receive a first rude impulse, to which it gave
itself up, and paid no regard to any thing else. The strength of the
original impetus only drove him farther from his object. His genius
constantly flew off in tangents, and came in contact with nature only
at salient points. There are two drawings of his from statues of a
lion and a lioness at Rome; the nose of the lioness is two straight
lines; the ears of the lion two curves, which might be mistaken for
horns; as if, after it had taken its first direction, he lost the use of
his hand, and his tools worked mechanically and monotonously without
his will. His enthusiasm and vigour were exhausted in the
conception; the execution was crude and abortive. His writings are
a greater acquisition to the art than his paintings. The powers of
conversation were what he most excelled in; and the influence which
he exercised in this way over all companies where he came, in spite
of the coarseness of his dress, and the frequent rudeness of his
manner, was great. Take him for all in all, he was a man of whose
memory it is impossible to think without admiration as well as
regret.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ORIGINALITY</h3>

<p class='c008'>Originality is any conception of things, taken immediately from nature,
and neither borrowed from, nor common to, others. To deserve this
appellation, the copy must be both true and new. But herein lies the
difficulty of reconciling a seeming contradiction in the terms of the
explanation. For as any thing to be <em>natural</em> must be referable to a
consistent principle, and as the face of things is open and familiar to
all, how can any imitation be new and striking, without being liable
to the charge of extravagance, distortion, and singularity? And, on
the other hand, if it has no such peculiar and distinguishing characteristic
to set it off, it cannot possibly rise above the level of the trite and
common-place. This objection would indeed hold good and be unanswerable,
if nature were one thing, or if the eye or mind comprehended
the whole of it at a single glance; in which case, if an object
had been once seen and copied in the most cursory and mechanical
way, there could be no farther addition to, or variation from, this idea,
without obliquity and affectation; but nature presents an endless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>variety of aspects, of which the mind seldom takes in more than a
part or than one view at a time; and it is in seizing on this unexplored
variety, and giving some one of these new but easily recognised
features, in its characteristic essence, and according to the peculiar
bent and force of the artist’s genius, that true originality consists.
<span class='sc'>Romney</span>, when he was first introduced into Sir <span class='sc'>Joshua’s</span> gallery, said,
‘there was something in his portraits which had been never seen in
the art before, but which every one must be struck with as true and
natural the moment he saw it.’ This could not happen if the human
face did not admit of being contemplated in several points of view,
or if the hand were necessarily faithful to the suggestions of sense.
Two things serve to perplex this question; first, the construction of
language, from which, as one object is represented by one word, we
imagine that it is one thing, and that we can no more conceive
differently of the same object than we can pronounce the same word
in different ways, without being wrong in all but one of them;
secondly, the very nature of our individual impressions puts a deception
upon us; for, as we know no more of any given object than we see,
we very pardonably conclude that we see the whole of it, and have
exhausted inquiry at the first view, since we can never suspect the
existence of that which, from our ignorance and incapacity, gives us
no intimation of itself. Thus, if we are shown an exact likeness of a
face, we give the artist credit chiefly for dexterity of hand; we think
that any one who has eyes can <em>see a face</em>; that one person sees it just
like another, that there can be no mistake about it (as the object and
the image are in our notion the same)—and that if there is any
departure from our version of it, it must be purely fantastical and
arbitrary. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Multum abludit imago.</span></i> We do not look beyond the
surface; or rather we do not see into the surface, which contains a
labyrinth of difficulties and distinctions, that not all the effects of art,
of time, patience, and study, can master and unfold. But let us
take this <em>self-evident proposition</em>, the human face, and examine it a
little; and we shall soon be convinced what a <em>Proteus</em>, what an inexplicable
riddle it is! Ask any one who thinks he has a perfect idea
of the face of his friend, what the shape of his nose or any other
feature is, and he will presently find his mistake;—ask a lover to
draw his ‘mistress’ eyebrow,’ it is not merely that his hand will fail
him, but his memory is at fault both for the form and colour; he may,
indeed, dream, and tell you with the poet, that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Grace is in all her steps, heaven in her eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>In every gesture, dignity and love’:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>but if he wishes to embody his favourite conceit, and to convince any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>one else of all this by proof positive, he must borrow the painter’s aid.
When a young artist first begins to make a study from a head, it is
well known that he has soon done, because after he has got in a
certain general outline and rude masses, as the forehead, the nose, the
mouth, the eyes in a general way, he sees no farther, and is obliged
to stop; he feels in truth that he has made a very indifferent copy, but
is quite at a loss how to supply the defect—after a few months’ or a
year or two’s practice, if he has a real eye for nature and a turn for
his art, he can spend whole days in working up the smallest details,
in correcting the proportions, in softening the gradations; and does
not know when to leave off, till night closes in upon him, and then he
sits musing and gazing in the twilight at what remains for his next
day’s work. Sir <span class='sc'>Joshua Reynolds</span> used to say, that if he did not
finish any one of his pictures till he saw nothing more to be done to
it, he should never leave off. <span class='sc'>Titian</span> wrote on his pictures, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">faciebat</span></i>—as
much as to say that he was about them, but that it was an endless
task. As the mind advances in the knowledge of nature, the
horizon of art enlarges and the air refines. Then, in addition to an
infinity of details, even in the most common object, there is the
variety of form and colour, of light and shade, of character and
expression, of the voluptuous, the thoughtful, the grand, the graceful,
the grave, the gay, the <em>I know not what</em>; which are all to be found
(separate or combined) in nature, which sufficiently account for the
diversity of art, and to detect and carry off the <em>spolia opima</em> of any
one of which is the highest praise of human genius and skill—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Whate’er Lorrain light-touch’d with softening hue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or savage Rosa dash’d, or learned Poussin drew.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>All that we meet with in the master-pieces of taste and genius is to be
found in the previous capacity of nature; and man, instead of adding
to the store, or <em>creating</em> any thing either as to matter or manner, can
only draw out a feeble and imperfect transcript, bit by bit, and one
appearance after another, according to the peculiar aptitude and affinity
that subsists between his mind and some one part. The mind
resembles a prism, which untwists the various rays of truth, and
displays them by different modes and in several parcels. Enough has
been said to vindicate both conditions of originality, which distinguish
it from singularity on the one hand and from vulgarity on the other;
or to show how a thing may at the same time be both true and new.
This novel truth is brought out when it meets with a strong congenial
mind—that is, with a mind in the highest degree susceptible of a certain
class of impressions, or of a certain kind of beauty or power; and
this peculiar strength, congeniality, truth of imagination, or command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>over a certain part of nature, is, in other words, what is meant
by <em>genius</em>. This will serve to show why original inventors have in
general (and except in what is mechanical), left so little for their
followers to improve upon; for as the original invention implies the
utmost stretch and felicity of thought, or the greatest strength and
sagacity to discover and dig the ore from the mine of truth, so it is
hardly to be expected that a greater degree of capacity should ever
arise (than the highest), that a greater mastery should be afterwards
obtained in shaping and fashioning the precious materials, than
in the first heat and eagerness of discovery; or that, if the capacity
were equal, the same scope and opportunity would be left for its
exercise in the same field. If the genius were different, it would
then seek different objects and a different vent, and open new paths
to fame and excellence, instead of treading in old ones. Hence the
well-known observation, that in each particular style or class of art,
the greatest works of genius are the earliest. Hence, also, the first
productions of men of genius are often their best. What was that
<em>something</em> that <span class='sc'>Romney</span> spoke of in <span class='sc'>Reynolds’s</span> pictures that the world
had never seen before, but with which they were enchanted the
moment they beheld it, and which both <span class='sc'>Hoppner</span> and <span class='sc'>Jackson</span>, with
all their merit, have but faintly imitated since? It was a reflection
of the artist’s mind—an emanation from his character, transferred to
the canvass. It was an ease, an amenity, an indolent but anxious
satisfaction, a graceful playfulness, belonging to his disposition, and
spreading its charm on all around it, attracting what harmonized with,
and softening and moulding what repelled it, avoiding every thing
hard, stiff, and formal, shrinking from details, reposing on effect, imparting
motion to <em>still life</em>, viewing all things in their ‘gayest, happiest
attitudes,’ and infusing his own spirit into nature as the leaven is
kneaded into the dough; but, though the original bias existed in
himself, and was thence stamped upon his works, yet the character
could neither have been formed without the constant recurrence and
pursuit of proper nourishment, nor could it have expressed itself without
a reference to those objects, looks, and attitudes in nature, which
soothed and assimilated with it. What made <span class='sc'>Hogarth</span> original and
inimitable, but the wonderful redundance, and, as it were, <em>supererogation</em>
of his genius, which poured the oil of humanity into the wounds
and bruises of human nature, redeemed, while it exposed, vice and
folly, made deformity pleasing, and turned misfortune into a jest?
But could he have done so if there were no enjoyment or wit in a
night-cellar, or if the cripple could not dance and sing? No, the
<em>moral</em> was in nature; but let no one dare to insist upon it after him,
in the same language and with the same pretensions! There was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span><span class='sc'>Rembrandt</span>—did he invent the extremes of light and shade, or was
he only the first that embodied them? He was so only because his
eye drank in light and shade more deeply than any one before or
since; and, therefore, the sunshine hung in liquid drops from his
pencil, and the dungeon’s gloom hovered over his canvass. Who can
think of <span class='sc'>Correggio</span> without a swimming of the head—the undulating
line, the melting grace, the objects advancing and retiring as in a
measured dance or solemn harmony! But all this fulness, roundness,
and delicacy, existed before in nature, and only found a fit sanctuary
in his mind. The breadth and masses of <span class='sc'>Michael Angelo</span> were
studies from nature, which he selected and cast in the mould of his
own manly and comprehensive genius. The landscapes of <span class='sc'>Claude</span>
are in a fixed repose, as if nothing could be moved from its place
without a violence to harmony and just proportion: in those of
<span class='sc'>Rubens</span> every thing is fluttering and in motion, light and indifferent,
as the winds blow where they list. All this is characteristic, original,
a different mode of nature, which the artist had the happiness to find
out and carry to the utmost point of perfection. It has been laid
down that no one paints any thing but his own character, and almost
features; and the workman is always to be traced in the work. Mr.
<span class='sc'>Fuseli’s</span> figures, if they were like nothing else, were like himself,
or resembled the contortions of a dream; <span class='sc'>Wilkie’s</span> have a parochial
air; <span class='sc'>Haydon’s</span> are heroical; Sir <span class='sc'>Thomas’s</span> genteel. What Englishman
could bear to sit to a French artist? What English artist could
hope to succeed in a French coquet? There is not only an individual
but a national bias, which is observable in the different schools and
productions of art. <em>Mannerism</em> is the bane (though it is the occasional
vice) of genius, and is the worst kind of imitation, for it is a
man’s imitating himself. Many artists go on repeating and caricaturing
themselves, till they complain that nature puts them out. Gross
plagiarism may consist with great originality. <span class='sc'>Sterne</span> was a
notorious plagiarist, but a true genius. His <cite>Corporal Trim</cite>, his <cite>Uncle
Toby</cite>, and <cite>Mr. Shandy</cite>, are to be found no where else. If <span class='sc'>Raphael</span>
had done nothing but borrow the two figures from <span class='sc'>Masaccio</span>, it
would have been impossible to say a word in his defence: no one
has a right to steal, who is not rich enough to be robbed by others.
So <span class='sc'>Milton</span> has borrowed more than almost any other writer; but he
has uniformly stamped a character of his own upon it. In what
relates to the immediate imitation of nature, people find it difficult to
conceive of an opening for originality, inasmuch as they think that
they themselves see the whole of nature, and that every other view of
it is wrong:—in what relates to the productions of imagination or
the discoveries of science, as they themselves are totally in the dark,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>they fancy the whole to be a fabrication, and give the inventor credit
for a sort of dealing with the Devil, or some preternatural kind of
talent. Poets lay a popular and prescriptive claim to inspiration:
the astronomer of old was thought able to conjure with the stars; and
the skilful leech, who performed unexpected cures was condemned for
a sorcerer. This is as great an error the other way. The vulgar
think there is nothing in what lies on the surface; though the learned
only see beyond it by stripping off incumbrances and coming to
another surface beneath the first. The difference between art and
science is only the difference between the <em>clothed</em> and <em>naked</em> figure:
but the veil of truth must be drawn aside before we can distinctly see
the face. The physician is qualified to prescribe remedies because
he is acquainted with the internal structure of the body, and has
studied the symptoms of disorders: the mathematician arrives at his
most surprising conclusions by slow and sure steps; and where he
can add discovery to discovery by the very certainty of the hold he
has of all the previous links. There is no witchcraft in either case.
The invention of the poet is little more than the fertility of a teeming
brain—that is, than the number and quantity of associations present
to his mind, and the various shapes in which he can turn them without
being distracted or losing a ‘semblable coherence’ of the parts;
as the man of observation and reflection strikes out just and unforeseen
remarks by taking off the mask of custom and appearances; or
by judging for himself of men and things, without taking it for granted
that they are what he has hitherto supposed them, or waiting to be
told by others what they are. If there were no foundation for an
unusual remark in our own consciousness or experience, it would not
strike us as a discovery: it would sound like a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu-d’esprit</span></i>, a whim
or oddity, or as flat nonsense. The mere mob, ‘the great vulgar and
the small,’ are not therefore capable of distinguishing between
originality and singularity, for they have no idea beyond the <em>commonplace</em>
of fashion or custom. Prejudice has no ears either for or against
itself; it is alike averse to objections and proofs, for both equally
disturb its blind implicit notions of things. Originality is, then, ‘the
strong conception’ of truth and nature ‘that the mind groans withal,’
and of which it cannot stay to be delivered by authority or example. It
is feeling the ground sufficiently firm under one’s feet to be able to go
alone. Truth is its essence; it is the strongest possible feeling of
truth; for it is a secret and instinctive yearning after, and approximation
towards it, before it is acknowledged by others, and almost before
the mind itself knows what it is. Paradox and eccentricity, on the
other hand, show a dearth of originality, as bombast and hyperbole
show a dearth of imagination; they are the desperate resources of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>affectation and want of power. Originality is necessary to genius;
for when that which, in the first instance, conferred the character, is
afterwards done by rule and routine, it ceases to be genius. To conclude,
the value of any work of art or science depends chiefly on the
quantity of originality contained in it, and which constitutes either the
charm of works of fiction or the improvement to be derived from
those of progressive information. But it is not so in matters of
opinion, where every individual thinks he can judge for himself, and
does not wish to be set right. There is, consequently, nothing that
the world like better than originality of invention, and nothing that
they hate worse than originality of thought. Advances in science
were formerly regarded with like jealousy, and stigmatised as
dangerous by the friends of religion and the state: <span class='sc'>Galileo</span> was
imprisoned in the same town of Florence, where they now preserve
his finger pointing to the skies!</p>

<h3 class='c003'>THE IDEAL</h3>

<p class='c008'>The <em>ideal</em> is the abstraction of any thing from all the circumstances
that weaken its effect, or lessen our admiration of it. Or it
is filling up the outline of truth or beauty existing in the mind,
so as to leave nothing wanting or to desire farther. The principle
of the <em>ideal</em> is the satisfaction we have in the contemplation of any
quality or object, which makes us seek to heighten, to prolong, or
extend that satisfaction to the utmost; and beyond this we cannot
go, for we cannot get beyond the highest conceivable degree of any
quality or excellence diffused over the whole of an object. Any
notion of perfection beyond is is a word without meaning—a thing
in the clouds. Another name for the <em>ideal</em> is the <em>divine</em>; for, what
we imagine of the Gods is pleasure without pain—power without
effort. The <em>ideal</em> is the impassive and immortal: it is that which
exists in and for itself; or is begot by the intense <em>idea</em> and innate
love of it. Hence it has been argued by some, as if it were brought
from another sphere, as <span class='sc'>Raphael</span> was said to have fetched his
<cite>Galatea</cite> from the skies; but it was the Gods, ‘the children of
<span class='sc'>Homer</span>,’ who peopled ‘the cloud-capt Olympus.’ The statue of
<cite>Venus</cite> was not beautiful because it represented a goddess; but it
was supposed to represent a goddess, because it was in the highest
degree (that the art or wit of man could make it so) and in every
part beautiful. Goddesses also walk the earth in the shape of
women; the height of nature surpasses the utmost stretch of the
imagination; the human form is alone the image of the divinity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>It has been usual to represent the <em>ideal</em> as an abstraction of general
nature, or as a <em>mean</em> or average proportion between different qualities
and faculties, which, instead of carrying any one to the highest point
of perfection or satisfaction, would only neutralise and damp the
impression. We take our notions on this subject chiefly from the
<em>antique</em>; but what higher conception do we form of the <cite>Jupiter</cite> of
<span class='sc'>Phidias</span> than that of power frowning in awful majesty? or of the
<cite>Minerva</cite> of the same hand, than that of wisdom, ‘severe in youthful
beauty?’ We shall do well not to refine in our theories beyond these
examples, that have been left us—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Inimitable on earth by model,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or by shading pencil shown.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>What is the <cite>Venus</cite>, the <cite>Apollo</cite>, the <cite>Hercules</cite>, but the personification
of beauty, grace, and strength, or the displaying these several
properties in every part of the attitude, face, and figure, and in the
utmost conceivable degree, but without confounding the particular
kinds of form or expression in an intermediate something, pretended
to be more perfect than either? A thing is not more perfect by becoming
something else, but by <em>being more itself</em>. If the face of the <cite>Venus</cite>
had been soft and feminine, but the figure had not corresponded, then this
would have been a defect of the <em>ideal</em>, which subdues the discordances
of Nature in the mould of passion, and so far from destroying
character, imparts the same character to all, according to a certain
established idea or preconception in the mind. The following up
the contrary principle would lead to the inevitable result, that the
most perfect, that is, the most abstract, representation of the human
form could contain neither age nor sex, neither character nor
expression, neither the attributes of motion nor rest, but a mere
unmeaning negation or doubtful balance of all positive qualities—in
fact, to propose to <em>embody an abstraction</em> is a contradiction in terms.
The attempt to carry such a scheme into execution would not
merely supersede all the varieties and accidents of nature, but
would effectually put a stop to the productions of art, or reduce
them to one vague and undefined abstraction, answering to the word
<em>man</em>. That amalgamation, then, of a number of different impressions
into one, which in some sense is felt to constitute the <em>ideal</em>, is not to
be sought in the dry and desert spaces or the endless void of
metaphysical abstraction, or by taking a number of things and
<em>muddling</em> them all together, but by singling out some one thing
or leading quality of an object, and making it the pervading and
regulating principle of all the rest, so as to produce the greatest
strength and harmony of effect. This is the natural progress of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>things, and accords with the ceaseless tendency of the human mind
from the <em>Finite</em> to the <em>Infinite</em>. If I see beauty, I do not want to
change it for power; if I am struck with power, I am no longer
in love with beauty; but I wish to make beauty still more beautiful,
power still more powerful, and to pamper and exalt the prevailing
impression, whatever it be, till it ends in a dream and a vision of
glory. This view of the subject has been often dwelt upon: I
shall endeavour to supply some inferences from it. The <em>ideal</em>, it
appears then by this account of it, is the enhancing and expanding
an idea from the satisfaction we take in it; or it is taking away
whatever divides, and adding whatever increases our sympathy with
pleasure and power ‘till our content is absolute,’ or at the height.
Hence that <em>repose</em> which has been remarked as one striking
condition of the <em>ideal</em>; for as it is nothing but the continued
approximation of the mind to the <em>great</em> and the <em>good</em>, so in the
attainment of this object it rejects as much as possible not only the
petty, the mean, and disagreeable, but also the agony and violence
of passion, the force of contrast, and the extravagance of imagination.
It is a law to itself. It relies on its own aspirations after pure
enjoyment and lofty contemplation alone, self-moved and self-sustained,
without the grosser stimulus of the irritation of the will,
privation, or suffering—unless when it is inured and reconciled to
the last (as an element of its being) by heroic fortitude, and when
‘strong patience conquers deep despair.’ In this sense, <span class='sc'>Milton</span>’s
<em>Satan</em> is <em>ideal</em>, though tragic: for it is permanent tragedy, or one
fixed idea without vicissitude or frailty, and where all the pride of
intellect and power is brought to bear in confronting and enduring
pain. Mr. <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span> has expressed this feeling of stoical
indifference (proof against outward impressions) admirably in the
poem of <cite>Laodamia</cite>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Know, virtue were not virtue, if the joys</div>
      <div class='line'>Of sense were able to return as fast</div>
      <div class='line'>And surely as they vanish. Earth destroys</div>
      <div class='line'>Those raptures duly: <em>Erebus disdains—</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Calm pleasures there abide, majestic pains</em>.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These lines are a noble description and example of the <em>ideal</em> in
poetry. But the <em>ideal</em> is not in general the stronghold of poetry.
For description in words (to produce any vivid impression) requires
a translation of the object into some other form, which is the
language of metaphor and imagination; as narrative can only interest
by a succession of events and a conflict of hopes and fears.
Therefore, the sphere of the <em>ideal</em> is in a manner limited to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Sculpture and Painting, where the object itself is given entire
without any possible change of circumstances, and where, though
the impression is momentary, it lasts for ever. Hence we may see
the failure in <cite>Sir Charles Grandison</cite>, which is an attempt to embody
this perfect or <em>ideal</em> character in a succession of actions without
passion, and in a variety of situations where he is still the same
everlasting coxcomb, and where we are tired to death of the
monotony, affectation, and self-conceit. The story of ‘Patient
Grizzle,’ however fine the sentiment, is far from dramatic: for the
<em>ideal</em> character, which is the self-sufficient, the immovable, and the
one, precludes change, or at least all motive for, or interest in, the
alternation of events, to which it constantly rises superior.
<span class='sc'>Shakspeare’s</span> characters are interesting and dramatic, in proportion
as they are not above passion and outward circumstances, that is, as
they are men and not angels. The Greek tragedies may serve to
explain how far the <em>ideal</em> and the <em>dramatic</em> are consistent; for the
characters there are almost as ideal as their statues, and almost as
impassive; and perhaps their extreme decorum and self-possession
is only rendered palatable to us by the story which nearly always
represents a conflict between Gods and men. The <em>ideal</em> part is,
however, necessary at all times to the grandeur of tragedy, since
it is the superiority of character to fortune and circumstances,
or the larger scope of thought and feeling thrown into it, that
redeems it from the charge of vulgar grossness or physical horrors.
Mrs. <span class='sc'>Siddons’s</span> acting had this character; that is to say, she kept
her state in the midst of the tempest of passion, and her eye surveyed,
not merely the present suffering, but the causes and consequences;
there was inherent power and dignity of manner. In a word, as
there is a sanguine temperament, and a health of body and mind which
floats us over daily annoyances and hindrances (instead of fastening
upon petty and disagreeable details), and turns every thing to
advantage, so it is in art and works of the imagination, the principle
of the <em>ideal</em> being neither more nor less than that fulness of satisfaction
and enlargement of comprehension in the mind itself that assists and
expands all that accords with it, and throws aside and triumphs over
whatever is adverse. Grace in movement is either that which is
continuous and consistent, from having no obstacles opposed to it, or
that which perseveres in this continuous and equable movement from
a <em>delight</em> in it, in spite of interruption or uneven ground; this last is
the <em>ideal</em>, or a persisting in, and giving effect to, our choice of the
good, notwithstanding the unfavourableness of the actual or outward
circumstances. We may in like manner trace the origin of dancing,
music, and poetry, which is the march of words. Self-possession is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>the <em>ideal</em> in ordinary behaviour. A low or vulgar character seizes on
every trifling or painful circumstance that occurs, from <em>irritability</em> and
want of imagination to look beyond the moment; while a person of
more refinement and capacity, or with a stronger predisposition of the
mind to good, and a greater fund of good sense and pleasurable
feeling to second it, despises these idle provocations, and preserves an
unruffled composure and serenity of temper. This internal character,
being permanent, communicates itself to the outward expression in
proportionable sweetness, delicacy, and unity of effect, which it
requires all the same characteristics of the mind to feel and convey to
others; and hence the superiority of <span class='sc'>Raphael’s</span> <cite>Madonnas</cite> over
<span class='sc'>Hogarth’s</span> faces. <em>Keeping</em> is not the <em>ideal</em>, for there may be <em>keeping</em>
in the little, the mean, and the disjointed, without strength, softness
or expansion. The Fauns and Satyrs of antiquity belong (like
other fabulous creations) rather to the grotesque than the <em>ideal</em>.
They may be considered, however, as a bastard species of the <em>ideal</em>,
for they stamp one prominent character of vice and deformity on the
whole face, instead of going into the minute, uncertain, and shuffling
details. As to the rest, the <em>ideal</em> abhors monsters and incongruity.
If the horses in the Elgin marbles, or the boar of <span class='sc'>Meleager</span>, are
ranked with the human figures, it is from their being perfect representations
of the forms and actions of the animals designed, not
caricatures half-way between the human and the brute.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ideal, then, is the highest point of purity and perfection to
which we can carry the idea of any object or quality. The natural
differs from the ideal style, inasmuch as what anything is differs from
what we wish and can conceive it to be. Many people would substitute
the phrase, from what it ought to be, to express the latter part
of the alternative, and would explain what a thing ought to be by that
which is best. But for myself, I do not understand, or at least it
does not appear to me, a self-evident proposition, either what a thing
ought to be, or what it is best that it should be; it is only shifting
the difficulty a remove farther, and begging the question a second
time. I may know what is good; I can tell what is better: but that
which is best is beyond me—it is a thing in the clouds. There is
perhaps also a species of cant—the making up for a want of clearness
of ideas by insinuating a pleasing moral inference—in the words purity
and perfection used above; but I would be understood as meaning by
purity nothing more than a freedom from alloy or any incongruous
mixture in a given quality or character of an object, and by perfection
completeness, or the extending that quality to all the parts and
circumstances of an object, so that it shall be as nearly as possible of
a piece. The imagination does not ordinarily bestow any pains on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>that which is mean and indifferent in itself, but having conceived an
interest in any thing, and the passions being once excited, we
endeavour to give them food and scope by making that which is
beautiful still more beautiful, that which is striking still more grand,
that which is hateful still more deformed, through the positive,
comparative, and superlative degrees, till the mind can go no farther in
this progression of fancy and passion without losing the original idea,
or quitting its hold of nature, which is the ground on which it still
rests with fluttering pinions. The ideal does not transform any
object into something else, or neutralize its character, but, by removing
what is irrelevant and supplying what was defective, makes it
more itself than it was before. I have included above the Fauns
and Satyrs, as well as the Heroes and Deities of antique art, or the
perfection of deformity as well as of beauty and strength, but any one
who pleases may draw the line, and leave out the exceptionable part;
it will make no difference in the principle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Venus is painted fair, with golden locks, but she must not be fair
beyond the fairness of woman—for the beauty we desire is that of
woman—nor must the hair be actually of the colour of gold, but only
approaching to it, for then it would no longer look like hair, but like
something else, and in striving to enhance the effect we should weaken
it. Habit, as well as passion, knowledge as well as desire, is one
part of the human mind; nor, in aiming at imaginary perfection, are
we to confound the understood boundaries and distinct classes of
things, or ‘to o’erstep the modesty of nature.’ We may rise the
superstructure of fancy as high as we please; the basis is custom.
We talk in words of an ivory skin, of golden tresses; but these are
but figures of speech, and a poetical licence. Richardson acknowledges
that Clarissa’s neck was not so white as the lace on it, whatever
the poets might say if they had been called upon to describe it.</p>

<h3 class='c003'>ROYAL ACADEMY</h3>

<p class='c008'>The choice of a President for this Society is one of some nicety.
Where there is not any individual taking a decided and indisputable
lead in art, it requires a combination and balance of qualities not always
easily to be met with. The President of the great body of art in this
country ought not merely to be eminent in his profession, but a man of
gentlemanly manners, of good person, of respectable character, and
standing well in the opinion of his brother artists. He should be a
person free from peculiarity of temper, from party spirit, and able to
represent the elegant arts (of which he stands at the head) as the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>ostensible link connecting scientific pursuit with the enlightened taste
and aristocratic refinements of their immediate patrons. The choice
has fallen upon Mr. <span class='sc'>Shee</span>, and his honours will sit well upon him.
This artist has been long a favourite with the public in the most
popular branch of his art, and is scarcely less distinguished by his
occasional brilliant effusions as a poet and his accomplishments as a
man. The characteristics of Mr. <span class='sc'>Shee’s</span> style of portrait painting are
vivacity of expression, facility of execution, and clearness of colouring.
He has attempted history with some success. Perhaps if he had done
more in this way, it might have been to his own detriment; and the
habits and studies of the historical painter, immersed in a world of
retirement and abstraction, are such as hardly serve for an introduction
to situations of ornament and distinction in social life. Mr. <span class='sc'>Wilkie’s</span>
merits as a painter of familiar subjects have procured him the deserved
honour of being appointed ‘historical painter to the King’—the
admirable busts of Mr. <span class='sc'>Chantrey</span> might also have been thrown into the
opposite scale; but, upon the whole, the judgment of the public will
not take the laurel from the head where the hands of the Academy
have placed it. If we might hint a fault where so much praise is
due, it would be by expressing a wish that Mr. <span class='sc'>Shee</span> could more
boldly say with Rembrandt, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je suis peintre, non pas teinturier</span></i>.’ His
tones are too pure, approaching too nearly to virgin tints. For one
department of his office the new President is happily qualified—we
mean the delivery of lectures from the Chair of the Royal Academy.
The art of painting is dumb but Mr. <span class='sc'>Shee</span> can borrow the aid of a
sister muse.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>NOTES</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c020'>PICTURE-GALLERIES IN ENGLAND</h3>

<p class='c021'>In 1824 a volume was published, entitled <cite>British Galleries of Art</cite>, ‘printed for
G. &amp; W. B. Whittaker, Ave-Maria-Lane,’ by Thomas Davison, Whitefriars,
which is sometimes put forward by second-hand booksellers as by William Hazlitt.
The articles composing the volume appeared in the <cite>New Monthly Magazine</cite> in
1823 (see vols. <span class='fss'>VII.</span> and <span class='fss'>VIII.</span>), and their subjects are in most cases identical with
those in Hazlitt’s <cite>Picture-Galleries in England</cite> (Angerstein, Dulwich, the Marquis
of Stafford’s Gallery, Windsor Castle, Hampton Court, Blenheim); apart from
the internal evidence, however, which is overwhelming, the anonymous author
says in his preface that ‘any merit that may attach to the mere plan of “British
Galleries of Art” belongs entirely to the author of [the <cite>Picture-Galleries in England</cite>],
the separate Papers of which appeared, (also in a periodical work) about the same
time with those of the following which are on the same subjects.’</p>

<p class='c000'>Hazlitt included his criticism on the pictures of Titian at the Marquis of
Stafford’s and at Windsor Castle in the Appendix to ‘The Life of Titian: with
anecdotes of the distinguished persons of his time. By James Northcote, Esq.,
R.A. In two volumes. London. Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley, 8, New
Burlington Street, 1830.’ See <cite>Memoirs of William Hazlitt</cite>, vol. <span class='fss'>II.</span> pp. 212–13, and
also the Biographical Sketch by Hazlitt’s son, contributed to <cite>The Literary Remains
of William Hazlitt</cite>, 1836, for particulars of Hazlitt’s share in Northcote’s work.
This Appendix to Northcote’s <cite>Titian</cite> also contains ‘Character of Titian’s Portraits’
from <cite>The Plain Speaker</cite> and ‘An Enquiry whether the Fine Arts are promoted by
Academies and Public Institutions.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The Second of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> papers was published in <cite>The Examiner</cite>,
November 10, 1816, and proceeds as in <cite>The Round Table</cite> to ‘the marring of
Art is the making of the Academy’ (vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 142); then add: ‘He would
have the Directors keep the old Masters under, by playing off upon them
the same tricks of background, situation, &amp;c. which they play off upon one
another’s pictures so successfully at the Academy Great Room. [Note.] The
Academicians having out-done nature at home, wait till their pictures are
hung up at the Academy to outdo one another. When they know their
exact situation in the Great Room, they set to work with double diligence
to paint up to their next neighbours, or to keep them under. Sometimes
they leave nearly the whole unfinished, that they may have a more <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
libitum</span></i> opportunity of annoying their friends, and of shining at their
expense.—had placed a landscape, consisting of one enormous sheet of white
lead, like the clean white napkin depending from the chin to the knees of
the Saturday night’s customers in a barber’s shop, under a whole length
of a lady by ——, in a white chalk dress, which made his Cleopatra look
like a dowdy. Our little lively knight of the brush goes me round the
room, crying out, “Who has any vermilion, who has any Indian yellow?”
and presently returns, and by making his whole length one red and yellow
daub, like the drop-curtain at Covent-Garden, makes the poor Academician’s
landscape look “pale as his shirt.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Such is the history of modern Art.
It is no wonder that “these fellows, who thus o’er-do Termagant,”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
should look with horror at the sobriety of ancient Art. It is no wonder
that they carry their contempt, hatred, and jealousy of one another, into
the Art itself.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After the end of the first <cite>Round Table</cite> paper (‘British Growth and Manufacture’)
add: ‘To what absurdities may we be reduced by the malice of folly!
The light of Art, like that of nature, shines on all alike; and its benefit,
like that of the sun, is in being seen and felt. Our Catalogue-makers,
like the puffers to the Gas-light Company, consider it only as a matter of
trade, or what they can get by the sale and monopoly of it; they would
extinguish all of it that does not come through the miserable chinks and
crannies of their patriotic sympathy, or would confine it in the hard
unfeeling sides of some body corporate, as Ariel was shut up in a cloven
pine by the foul witch Sycorax. The cabal of Art in this country would
keep it on the other side of the Channel. They would keep up a perpetual
quarantine against it as infectious. They would subject it to new custom-house
duties. They would create a right of search after all works of
genuine Art as contraband. They would establish an alien-office<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a> under
the Royal Academy, to send all the finest pictures out of the country, to
prevent unfair and invidious competition. The genius of modern Art does
not bathe in the dews of Castalie, but rises like the dirty goddess of Gay’s
<cite>Trivia</cite> out of the Thames, just opposite Somerset-House, and armed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>a Grub-street pen in one hand, and a sign-post brush in the other, frightens
the Arts from advancing any farther. They would thus effectually suppress
the works of ancient genius and the progress of modern taste at one and
the same time; and if they did not sell their pictures, would find ease
to their tortured minds by not seeing others admired.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The Second of the <cite>Examiner</cite> articles includes the first paragraph of the
second of the <cite>Round Table</cite> articles and ends with ‘encouragement of
the Fine Arts?’ (vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 147). A letter follows, signed H. R., protesting
against being pointed out as the author of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite>, to
which the following paragraph is added in square brackets:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘We insert the above letter as in duty bound; for it is a sad thing to
labour under the imputation of being the author of the Catalogue—“that
deed without a name.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a> But we hardly know how to reply to our
Correspondent, unless by repeating what Mr. Brumell said of the Regent—“Who
is our fat friend?” We do not know his person or address, or by
what marks he identifies himself with our description of him—Whether he
answers to his name as a cheese-curd, or a piece of whitleather, or as a
Shrewsbury Cake; or as a stocking, or a joint-stool; or as a little round
man, or as a fair squab man? If he claims any or all of these marks as
his property, he is welcome to them. We shall believe him. We shall
also believe him, when he says he is not the anonymous author of the
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite>; and in that case, we can have no farther fault to find
with him, even though he were the beautiful Albiness.’</p>

<p class='c000'>The Third of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> articles was published in <cite>The Examiner</cite>,
Nov. 17, 1816, and proceeds as in <cite>The Round Table</cite> with the following
additions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quotation from Burke to Barry (vol. I. p. 148) has the following footnote:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Yet Mr. Burke knew something of Art and of the world. He thought
the Art should be encouraged for the sake of Artists. They think it
should be destroyed for their sakes. They would cut it up at once, as the
boy did the goose with golden eggs.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>such heavy drollery</em> (vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 150) add: ‘with the stupid, knowing air
of a horse-jockey or farrier, and in the right <em>slang</em> of the veterinary art.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>will speak more</em> (Ibid.) add: ‘We concluded our last with some remarks
on Claude’s landscapes. We shall return to them here; and we would
ask those who have seen them at the British Institution, “Is the general
effect,”’ etc. [here Hazlitt inserted the criticism on Claude he used later in
the article on <cite>Fine Arts for the Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, see p. <a href='#Page_394'>394</a> of the
present volume, ending with ‘What landscape-painter does not feel this
of Claude?’]</p>

<p class='c000'>‘It seems the author of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Catalogue Raisonné</span></cite> does not; for he thus
speaks of him:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>David Encamped.</em>—<cite>Claude.</cite> <cite>Rev. W. H. Carr</cite>:—If it were not for the
horrible composition of this landscape—the tasteless hole in the wall—the
tents and daddy-long-legs, whom Mr. Carr has christened King David,
we should be greatly offended by its present obtrusion on the public; as it
is, we are bound to suppose the possessor sees deeper into the mill-stone
than ourselves; and if it were politic, could thoroughly explain the matter
to our satisfaction. <em>Be this as it may, we cannot resist expressing our regret
at the absence of Claude Gillee’s Muses.—The Public in general merely know, by
tradition, that this painter was a pastry-cook: had this delectable composition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>which we now allude been brought forward, they would have had the evidence
of his practice to confirm it. It is said to represent Mount Parnassus; and no
one, who for a moment has seen the picture, can entertain the smallest doubt of
its having been taken from one of his own Plateaux. The figures have all the
character and drawing which they might be expected to derive from a species of
twelfth-cake casts. The swans are of the truest wax-shapes, while the water
bears every mark of being done from something as right-earnest as that at
Sadler’s Wells, and the Prince’s Fete of 1814.</em>”</p>

<p class='c000'>‘This is the way in which the Catalogue-writer aids and abets the Royal
Academy in the promotion and encouragement of the Fine Arts in this
country. Now, what if we were to imitate him, and to say of the “ablest
landscape-painter now living,” that.... No, we will not; we have
blotted out the passage after we had written it—Because it would be bad
wit, bad manners, and bad reasoning. Yet we dare be sworn it is as good

Suppose we were to put forth voluntarily such a criticism on one of Mr.
Turner’s landscapes? What then? we should do a great injustice to an
able and ingenious man, and disgrace ourselves: but we should not hurt a
sentiment, we should not mar a principle, we should not invade the
sanctuary of Art. Mr. Turner’s pictures have not, like Claude’s, become
a sentiment in the heart of Europe; his fame has not been stamped and
rendered sacred by the hand of time. Perhaps it never will.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c012'>ON THE ELGIN MARBLES</h4>

<p class='c021'>Two papers from <cite>The London Magazine</cite>, February and May 1822. The second
article began with the paragraph at the foot of p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>. On p. <a href='#Page_344'>344</a>, l. 9 from foot,
the following sentence in the <cite>Magazine</cite> is inserted after the words ‘The Ilissus or
River-god’:—‘(of which we have given a print in a former number).’ The
frontispiece to the February number was an engraving of the Ilissus by J. Shury.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1816 Hazlitt contributed two ‘Literary Notices’ to <cite>The Examiner</cite> (June 16
and 30), on the <cite>Report from the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Elgin
Marbles</cite>.—Murray. The second of these two ‘notices’ formed the basis of the
<cite>London Magazine</cite> article. Certain paragraphs not given in the later <cite>London
Magazine</cite> form (the text adopted here) are given below. The first of <cite>The Examiner</cite>
‘notices’ will be found in the Appendix to the present volume.</p>

<p class='c000'><cite>The Examiner</cite> article, June 30, begins with the quotation from Cowley and then
adds, before the paragraph beginning ‘The true lesson,’ etc., the following: ‘According
to the account of Pliny, it does not appear certain that Phidias ever
worked in marble. He mentions indeed a marble Venus at Rome, conjectured to
be his; and another at Athens, without the walls, done by his scholar Alcamenes,
to which Phidias was said to have put the last hand. His chief works, according
to this historian, were the Olympian Jupiter, and the Minerva in the Parthenon,
both in ivory: he executed other known works in brass. The words of Pliny, in
speaking of Phidias, are remarkable:—[“That the name of Phidias is illustrious&nbsp;...
magnificence even in small things.”—<cite>Natural History</cite>, Book xxxvi.].</p>

<p class='c000'>‘It appears, by the above description, that Phidias did not make choice of the
colossal height of this statue with a view to make size a substitute for grandeur;
but in order that he might be able, among other things, to finish, fill up, and enrich
every part as much as possible. Size assists grandeur in genuine art only by
enabling the Artist to give a more perfect developement to the parts of which the
whole is composed. A miniature is inferior to a full-sized picture, not because it
does not give the large and general outline, but because it does not give the smaller
varieties and finer elements of nature. As a proof of this (if the thing were not
self-evident), the copy of a good portrait will always make a highly-finished
miniature, but the copy of a good miniature, if enlarged to the size of life, will
make but a very vapid portrait. Some of our own Artists, who are fond of painting
large figures, either misunderstand or misapply this principle. They make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>whole figure gigantic, not that they may have room for nature, but for the motion
of their brush, regarding the quantity of canvas they have to cover as an excuse for
the slovenly and hasty manner in which they cover it; and thus in fact leave
their pictures nothing at last but monstrous miniatures.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘We should hardly have ventured to mention this figure of five and thirty
feet high, which might give an inordinate expansion to the ideas of our contemporaries,
but that the labour and pains bestowed upon every part of it,—the
thirty Gods carved on the pedestal, the battle of the Centaurs and Lapithæ on
the sandals, would at once make their magnificent projects shrink into a nutshell,
or bring them within the compass of reason.—We had another inducement for
extracting Pliny’s account of the Minerva of Phidias, which was, to check any
inclination on the part of our students to infer from the Elgin Marbles, that the
perfection of ancient Grecian art consisted in the imperfect state in which its
earliest remains have come down to us; or to think that fragments are better
than whole works, that the trunk is more valuable without the head, and that the
grandeur of the antique consists in the ruin and decay into which it has fallen
through time.’</p>

(for the benefit of the Fine Arts in this kingdom) to produce two casts
from actual nature, which if they do not furnish practical proof of all that
we have here advanced, we are willing to forfeit all that we are worth—a
theory’ [see p. <a href='#Page_331'>331</a>, present volume]. The article then ends with the ten
principles and the following note: ‘We shall conclude with expressing a
hope, that the Elgin Marbles may not be made another national stop-gap
between nature and art.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘In answer to some objections to what was said in a former article on the
comparative propriety of removing these statues, we beg leave to put one
question. It appears from the Report of the Committee, that the French
Government were, in the year 1811, anxious to purchase the collection of
Lord Elgin, who was then a prisoner in France. We ask then, supposing
this to have been done, what would have become of it? Would not the
Theseus and the Neptune have been solemnly sent back, like malefactors,
“to the place from whence they came?”—Yes, to be sure.—The Rev. Dr.
Philip Hunt, in the service of Lord Elgin, declares, in his evidence before
the Committee, that no objection was made nor regret expressed by the
inhabitants at the removal of the Marbles. In the notes to <cite>Childe Harold’s
Pilgrimage</cite>,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a> we find the following extract of a letter from Dr. Clarke to
Lord Byron:—“When the last of the Metopes was taken from the
Parthenon, and in moving it, great part of the superstructure, with one of
triglyphs, was thrown down by the workmen whom Lord Elgin employed,
the Disdar, who beheld the mischief done to the building, took his pipe
from His mouth, dropped a tear, and in a supplicating tone of voice, said to
Lusieri, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Telos</span></i>! I was present.’”—It appears that Dr. Philip Hunt was not.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>worth considering</em> add: ‘From the great and substantial merits of the
late President, we have as little the inclination as the power to detract.
But we certainly think that they have been sometimes over-rated from
the partiality of friends and from the influence of fashion. However
necessary and useful the ebullitions of public or private enthusiasm may be
to counteract the common prejudices against new claims to reputation, and
to lift rising genius to its just rank, there is a time when, having accomplished
its end, our zeal may be suffered to subside into discretion, and
when it becomes as proper to restrain our admiration as it was before to
give a loose to it. It is only by having undergone this double ordeal
that reputation can ever be established on a solid basis—that popularity
becomes fame.’</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Hudson.</em> Thomas Hudson (1701–1779), one of the most fashionable portrait

<p class='c000'><em>Richardson.</em> Jonathan Richardson (1665–1745), portrait painter and writer

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_398'>398</a>. After <em>proportion or form</em> add: ‘This distinction has not been sufficiently
attended to. Mr. West, for example, has considerable knowledge of
drawing, as it relates to proportion, to the anatomical measurements of the
human body. He has not the least conception of elegance or grandeur of
form. The one is matter of mechanical knowledge, the other of taste and
feeling. Rubens was deficient in the anatomical measurements, as well as
in the marking of the muscles: but he had as fine an eye as possible for
what may be called <em>the picturesque</em> in form, both in the composition of his
figures and in the particular parts. In all that relates to the expression
of motion, that is, to ease, freedom, and elasticity of form, he was
unrivalled. He was as superior to Mr. West in his power of drawing, as
in his power of colouring.—Correggio’s proportions are said to have been
often incorrect: but his feeling of beauty, and grace of outline, was of the
most exquisite kind.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span><a href='#Page_399'>399</a>. After <em>and some others</em> add the following footnote: ‘Our references are
generally made to pictures in the late exhibition of Sir Joshua’s works in
the British Gallery.’</p>

<p class='c000'><em>No mark or likelihood.</em> <cite>1 King Henry IV.</cite>, Act <span class='fss'>III.</span> Sc. 2.</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>downright portraits and nothing more</em>, add: ‘What if he had painted
them on the theory of middle forms, or pounded their features together in
the same metaphysical mortar? Mr. Westall might just as well have
painted them. They would have been of no more value than his own
pictures of Mr. Tomkins,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a> the penman, or Mrs. Robinson,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a> who is painted
with a hat and feather, or Mrs. Billington,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a> who is painted as St. Cecilia,
or than the Prince of Wales and Duke of York, or the portraits of Sir
George and Lady Beaumont. Would the artist in this case have conferred
the same benefit on the public, or have added as much to the stock of our
ideas, as by giving us <em>fac-similes</em> of the most interesting characters of the
time, with whom we seem, from his representations of them, to be almost
as well acquainted as if we had known them, and to remember their
persons as well as their writings? Yet we would rather have seen Johnson,
or Goldsmith, or Burke, than their portraits. This shows that the effect
of the pictures would not have been the worse, if they had been the more
finished, and more detailed: for there is nothing so true, either to the
details or to the general effect, as nature. The only celebrated person of
this period whom we have seen is Mr. Sheridan, whose face, we have no
hesitation in saying, contains a great deal more, and is better worth seeing,
than Sir Joshua’s picture of him.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>stiff and confined</em> add: ‘But there is a medium between primness and
hoydening.’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_400'>400</a>. After <em>ease and elegance</em> add: ‘Sir Joshua seems more than once (both
theoretically and practically) to have borrowed his idea of positive excellence
from a negation of the opposite defect. His tastes led him to reject
the faults, which he had observed in others; but he had not always power
to realize his own idea of perfection, or to ascertain precisely in what it
consisted. His colouring also wanted that purity, delicacy, and transparent
smoothness, which gives such an exquisite charm to Vandyke’s women.
Vandyke’s portraits (mostly of English women) in the Louvre, have a cool,
refreshing air about them, a look of simplicity and modesty even in the
very tone, which forms a fine contrast to the voluptuous glow and mellow
golden lustre of Titian’s Italian women. There is a quality of flesh-colour
in Vandyke, which is to be found in no other painter, neither in Titian,
Rubens, nor Rembrandt; nor is it in Reynolds, for he had nothing which
was not taken from those three. It exactly conveys the idea of the soft,
smooth, sliding, continuous, delicately varied surface of the skin. Correggio
approached nearer to it, though his principle of light and shade was totally
different. The objects in Vandyke have the least possible difference of
light and shade, and are presented to the eye without being reflected through
any other medium. It is this extreme purity and clearness of tone, together
with the elegance and precision of his particular forms,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a> that places Vandyke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>in the first rank of portrait-painters. As Reynolds had not his defects, he
had not his excellences. We accidentally saw the late Lady Mount-Joy
at the exhibition of Sir Joshua’s works in Pall-mall: nor could we help
contrasting the dazzling clearness of complexion, the delicacy and distinctness
of the form of the features, with the half made-up and faded beauties
which hung on the walls, and which comparatively resembled paste figures,
smeared over with paint. We doubt whether the same effect would have
been produced in a fine collection of Vandyke’s. In the gallery of Blenheim,
there is a family picture of the Duchess of Buckingham with her children,
which is a pure mirrour of fashion. The picture produces the same sort of
respect and silence as if the spectator had been introduced into a family
circle of the highest rank, at a period when rank was a greater distinction
than it is at present. The delicate attention and mild solicitude of the
mother are admirable, but two of the children surpass description. The
one is a young girl of nine or ten, who looks as if “the winds of heaven
had not been permitted to visit her face too roughly”;<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a> she stands before
her mother in all the pride of childish self-importance, and studied display
of artificial prettinesses, with a consciousness that the least departure from
strict propriety or decorum will be instantly detected; the other is a little
round-faced chubby boy, who stands quite at his ease behind his mother’s
chair, with a fine rosy glow of health in his cheeks, through which the
blood is seen circulating. It was like seeing the objects reflected in a glass.
The picture of the late Duke and Duchess of Marlborough and their
children, in the same room, painted by Sir Joshua, appear coarse and tawdry
when compared with “the soft precision of the clear Vandyke.”’<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_400'>400</a>. After <em>borrowed from Correggio</em> add: ‘Sir Joshua has only repeated the same
idea <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i>, and has, besides, caricatured it. It has been said that his
children were unrivalled. Titian’s, Raphael’s, and Correggio’s were much
superior. Those of Rubens and Poussin were at least equal. If any one
should hesitate as to the last painter in particular, we would refer them to
the picture (at Lord Grosvenor’s) of the children paying adoration to the
infant Christ, or to the children drinking in the picture of Moses striking
the rock. Our making these comparisons or giving these preferences is
not, we conceive, any disparagement to Sir Joshua. Did we not think
highly of him, we might well blush to make them.’</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Infant Samuel.</em> The passage in <cite>The Champion</cite> is slightly different, and
quotes a few lines from Mr. Sotheby’s poetical Epistle to Sir G. Beaumont
describing the infant Jupiter and the infant Samuel. William Sotheby
(1757–1833) was horse-soldier, friend of Sir Walter Scott, and poet.</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>but the name</em> add: ‘Sir Joshua himself (as it appears from his biographers)
had no idea of a subject in painting them, till some ignorant
and officious admirer undertook to supply the deficiency. What can be
more trifling than giving the portrait of Kitty Fisher<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a> the mock-heroic
title of Cleopatra?’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_401'>401</a>. <em>Count Ugolino.</em> The story will be found in <cite>The Inferno</cite>, Canto <span class='fss'>XXXIII.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>rest of the figures</em> add: ‘who look very much like apprentices hired to
sit for the occasion from some neighbouring workshop. There is one
pleasing and natural figure of a little boy kneeling at his father’s feet, but
it has no relation to the supposed story.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>401. After <em>charitable donation</em> add: ‘There is all the difference between what the
picture is and what it ought to be, that there is between Crabbe and
Dante.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>which they are borne?</em> add: ‘Nothing! Yet Dr. Warton,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a> who has
related this story so well; Burke, who wrote that fine description of the
effects of famine;<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Goldsmith, and all his other friends, were satisfied with
his success. Why then should not Sir Joshua be so too?—Because he was
bound to understand the language which he used, as well as that which
was given him to translate.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>dreadful objects</em> add: ‘The idea of Macbeth seems to be taken from
the passage in Shakespear—“Why stands Macbeth thus amazedly?”<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
The poet has in this taunting question of the witches laid open the inmost
movements of his mind. Why has the painter turned his face from us?’
Then, the Cardinal Beaufort passage having been given before instead of
after that about Macbeth, the <cite>Champion</cite> article ends thus:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘“Garrick between tragedy and comedy” is, to say the best, a very indifferent
performance. He appears to be “grinning for a wager.” We
cannot conceive how any two ladies should contend for such a prize, nor
how he should be divided between them. The muse of comedy is as
childish and insipid as the muse of tragedy is cold and repulsive. The
whole is mere affectation without an idea. Mrs. Siddons, as the tragic
muse, is an improvement on the same false style. It is not Mrs. Siddons,
nor is it the tragic muse, but something between both, and neither. We
would ask those who pretend to admire this composition, whether they
think it would convey to any one who had never seen the original, the
least idea of the power of that wonderful actress in any one of her
characters, and as it relates to the expression of countenance alone? That
it gives an idea of any thing finer, is what we cannot readily make up our
minds to. We ought perhaps in fairness to close these remarks with a
confession of our weakness.—There was one picture which affected us
more than all the rest, because it seemed to convey the true feeling of the
story, and that was the picture of the Children in the Wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘To return once more to Sir Joshua’s general character as a painter. He
has been compared to Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Vandyke, Rembrandt, and
Correggio, and said to unite all their excellences. It will be well to
qualify this praise. He had little congeniality of mind, except with the
two last, more particularly Rembrandt. Of Raphael, it is needless to say
any thing. He had very little of Titian’s manner, except perhaps a greater
breadth and uniform richness of colour than he would have acquired from
Rembrandt. He had none of the dignity or animation of Titian’s
portraits. It is not speaking too highly of the portraits of Titian to say,
that they have as much expression, that is, convey as fine an idea of
intellect and feeling, as the historical heads of Raphael. The difference
seems to be only, that the expression in Raphael is more contemplative and
philosophical, and in Titian more personal and constitutional. In the
portraits of the latter, the Italian character always predominates: there is
a look of piercing sagacity, of commanding intellect, of acute sensibility,
which it would be in vain to expect to find in English portraits. The
daring spirit and irritable passions of the age and country are as distinctly
stamped upon the countenances, and can be as little mistaken as the
costume which they wear. Many of them look as if it would be hardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>safe to be left in the room with them, so completely do they convey the
idea of superiority.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a> The portraits of Raphael, though full of profound
thought and character, have more of common humanity about them.—Of
Vandyke, as we have observed before, Sir Joshua had neither the
excellences nor defects. Some years ago, we saw his picture of the
Marquis of Granby, and Vandyke’s picture of Charles I. (engraved by
Strange<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a>) standing by one another, in the Louvre. The difference was
striking. The portrait of the nobleman looked heavy and muddled, from
the mode of heaping on the colours, and the determination to produce
effect alone without attention to the subordinate details defeated itself.
The portrait of the unfortunate monarch, on the contrary, displayed the
utmost delicacy and facility of execution. Every part would bear the
nicest inspection, and yet the whole composition, the monarch, the figure
of the horse, and the attendants, had all the distinctness, lightness, and
transparency of objects seen in the open air. There are some persons who
will still prefer the former mode of execution as more bold and dashing.
For the same reason, we might prefer the copies of the head of the Marquis
of Granby, which we so often see in conspicuous situations in the vicinity
of the metropolis, to the original.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Of Rubens our admired countryman had neither the facility nor
brilliancy. He was crude and heavy both in drawing and colour, compared
with the Flemish painter. Rembrandt was the painter of all others whom
Sir Joshua most resembled, and from whom he borrowed most. Strong
masses of light and shade, harmony and clearness of tone, the production
of effect by masterly, broad, and rapid execution were in general the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">forte</span></i>
of both these painters. Rembrandt had the priority in the order of time,
and also in power of hand and eye. There are no pictures of Reynolds’
which will stand against the best of Rembrandt’s for striking effect and
an intense feeling of nature. They are faint, slovenly, dingy, and commonplace
in comparison. Rembrandt had even greater versatility of genius.
He had an eye for all objects as far as he had seen them. His history and
landscapes are equally fine in their way. He might be said to have created
a style of his own, which he also perfected. In fact, he is one of the great
founders and legislators of art. Of Correggio, Reynolds borrowed little
but the air of some of his female heads, and the models of his children,
which he injudiciously overloaded with the massy light and shade of
Rembrandt, instead of the tender <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaro-scuro</span></i> of Correggio, the only
colouring proper for that kind of soft, undulating, retiring line of beauty.
We shall sum up our opinion by saying, that we do not find in the works
of Sir Joshua either the majesty and power, the delicacy and refinement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>the luxurious splendour, and dazzling invention, neither the same originality
of conception, nor perfect execution, which are to be found in the greatest
painters. Nevertheless, his works did honour to his art and to his
country.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>It has flourished.</em> The remainder of the essay is based on the two <cite>Champion</cite>
articles of August 28 and September 11, 1814. The first one begins:—</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The Directors of the British Institution conclude the preface to their
catalogue of the works of Hogarth, Wilson, &amp;c. in the following words....</p>

<p class='c000'>‘“The present exhibition, while it gratifies the taste and feeling of the
lover of art, may tend to excite animating reflections in the mind of the
artist: <em>if at a time when the art received little comparative support such works
were produced, a reasonable hope may be entertained that we shall see productions
of still higher attainment, under more encouraging circumstances</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>‘It should seem that a contrary conclusion might more naturally have
suggested itself from a contemplation of the collection, with which the
Directors of the Institution have so highly gratified the public taste and
feeling. When the real lover of art looks round, and sees the works of
Hogarth and of Wilson,—works which were produced in obscurity and
poverty,—and recollects the pomp and pride of patronage under which
these works are at present recommended to public notice, the obvious inference
which strikes him is, how little the production of such works
depends on “the most encouraging circumstances.” The visits of the gods
of old did not always add to the felicity of those whose guests they were;
nor do we know that the countenance and favours of the great will lift the
arts to that height of excellence, or will confer all those advantages which
are expected from the proffered boon. The arts are of humble growth and
station; they are the product of labour and self-denial; they have their
seat in the heart of man, and in his imagination; it is there they labour,
have their triumphs there, and unseen and unthought of, perform their
ceaseless task.—Indeed, patronage, and works of art deserving patronage,
rarely exist together; for it is only when the arts have attracted public
esteem, and reflect credit on the patron, that they receive this flattering
support, and then it generally proves fatal to them. We really do not see
how the man of genius should be improved by being transplanted from his
closet to the anti-chambers of the great, or to a fashionable rout. He has
no business there—but to bow, to flatter, to smile, to submit to the caprice
of taste, to adjust his dress, to think of nothing but his own person and his
own interest, to talk of the antique, and furnish designs for the lids of snuffboxes,
and ladies’ fans!</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The passage above alluded to evidently proceeds on the common mistaken
notion, that the progress of the arts depends entirely on the cultivation
and encouragement bestowed on them; as if taste and genius were perfectly
mechanical, arbitrary things,—as if they could be bought and sold, and
regularly contracted for at a given price. It confounds the fine arts with
the mechanic arts,—art with science. It supposes that feeling, imagination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>invention, are the creatures of positive institution; that the temples of the
muses may be raised and supported by voluntary contribution; that we
can enshrine the soul of art in a stately pile, of royal patronage, inspire
corporate bodies with taste, and carve out the direction to fame in letters
of stone on the front of public buildings. That the arts in any country
may be at so low an ebb as to be capable of great improvement by positive
means, so as to reach the common level to which such means can carry
them, there is no doubt or question: but after they have in any particular
instance by native genius and industry reached their highest eminence, to
say that they will, by mere artificial props and officious encouragement,
arrive at a point of “still higher attainment,” is assuming a good deal too
much. Are we to understand that the laudable efforts of the British
Institution are likely, by the mere operation of natural causes, to produce
a greater comic painter, a more profound describer of manners than
Hogarth? Or even that the lights and expectations held out in the preface
to the British catalogue, will enable some one speedily to surpass the
general excellence of Wilson’s landscapes? Is there anything in the history
of art to warrant such a conclusion—to support this theory of progressive
perfectibility under the auspices of patrons and vice-patrons, presidents and
select committees?</p>

<p class='c000'>‘On the contrary, as far as the general theory is concerned the traces of
youth, manhood, and old age, are almost as distinctly marked in the history
of the art as of the individual. The arts have in general risen rapidly from
their first obscure dawn to their meridian height and greatest lustre, and
have no sooner reached this proud eminence than they have as rapidly
hastened to decay and desolation.’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_409'>409</a>. After <em>symmetry of form</em> add: ‘What then has the Genius of progressive
improvement been doing all this time? Has he been reposing after his
labours? How is it that the moderns are still so far behind, notwithstanding
all that was done ready to their hands by the ancients,—when they
possess a double advantage over them, and have not nature only to form
themselves upon, but nature and the antique?’</p>

<p class='c000'>‘We intend to offer a few general observations in illustration of this view of
the subject, which appears to us to be just. There are three ways in which
institutions for the promotion of the fine arts may be supposed to favour
the object in view; either by furnishing the best models to the student,—or
by holding out the prospect of immediate patronage and reward,—or by
diffusing a more general taste for the arts. All of these so far from
answering the end proposed, will be found on examination, to have a
contrary tendency.’</p>

<p class='c000'>[The second paper in <cite>The Champion</cite> begins here, with the motto: ‘It was
ever the trick of our English nation, if they had a good thing, to make it
too common.’]</p>

<p class='c000'>‘We observed in the conclusion of our last article on this subject, that
there were three ways in which academies or public institutions might be
supposed to promote the fine arts,—either by furnishing the best models to
the student, or by holding out immediate emolument and patronage, or by
improving the public taste. We shall consider each of these in order.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘First, a constant reference to the best models of art necessarily tends to
enervate the mind, to intercept our view of nature, and to distract the
attention by a variety of unattainable excellence. An intimate acquaintance
with the works of the celebrated masters, may, indeed, add to the
indolent refinements of taste, but will never produce one work of original
genius,—one great artist.’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_409'>409</a>. <em>Cimabue.</em> Giovanni Cimabue, of Florence (1240-?1302), the ‘Father of
Modern Painting,’ or more accurately, whose work marks the close of the
old school before the opening of the new by his pupil Giotto and others.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Massacio.</em> Tommaso Guidi, or Masaccio (Slovenly Tommy, for his careless
manners), Florentine painter (1401–1428).</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Carlo Maratti.</em> See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, note to p. <a href='#Page_19'>19</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Raphael Mengs.</em> See <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, note to p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>pretend to combine</em> add: ‘Inoffensive insipidity is the utmost that can
ever be expected, because it is the utmost that ever was attained, from the
desire to produce a balance of good qualities, and to animate lifeless
compositions by the transfusion of a spirit of originality.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>uniform mediocrity</em> add: ‘There is a certain pedantry, a given division
of labour, an almost exclusive attention to some one object, which is
necessary in Art, as in all the works of man. Without this, the unavoidable
consequence is a gradual dissipation and prostitution of intellect,
which leaves the mind without energy to devote to any pursuit the pains
necessary to excel in it, and suspends every purpose in irritable imbecility.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>But the modern painter is bound not only to run the circle of his own art,
but of all others. He must be “statesman, chemist, fiddler, and buffoon.”<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
He must have too many accomplishments to excel in his profession.
When every one is bound to know every thing, there is no time to do any
thing. Besides, the student,’ etc.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_410'>410</a>. After <em>grace of Raphael</em> instead of ‘and ends in nothing’ substitute: ‘finds it
easier to copy pictures than to paint them, and easier to <em>see</em> than to copy
them, takes infinite pains to gain admission to all the great collections,
lounges from one auction room to another, and writes newspaper criticisms
on the Fine Arts——.’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_411'>411</a>. After <em>ever he realized</em> add: ‘It is beating up for raw dependents, sending out
into the highways for the halt, the lame, and the blind, and making a
scramble among a set of idle boys for prizes of the first, second, and third class,
like those we make among children for gingerbread toys. True patronage
does not consist in ostentatious professions of high keeping, and promiscuous
intercourse with the arts.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>self-constituted judge</em> add: ‘Whenever vanity and self importance are
(as in general they must be) the governing principles of systems of public
patronage, there is an end at once of all candour and directness of conduct.
Their decisions are before the public: and the individuals who take the
lead in these decisions are responsible for them.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>pauperism about it</em> add: ‘They neglect or treat with insult the
favourite whom they suspect of having fallen off in the opinion of the
public; but, if he is able to recover his ground without their assistance, are
ready to heap their mercenary bounties upon those of others, greet him
with friendly congratulations, and share his triumph with him.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>common faith</em> add the following footnote: ‘Of the effect of the <em>authority</em>
of the subject of a composition, in suspending the exercise of personal taste
and feeling in the spectators, we have a striking instance in our own
country, where this cause must, from collateral circumstances, operate less
forcibly. Mr. West’s pictures would not be tolerated but from the respect
inspired by the subjects of which he treats. When a young lady and her
mother, the wife and daughter of a clergyman, are told, that a gawky ill-favoured
youth is the beloved disciple of Christ, and that a tall, starched
figure of a woman visible near him is the Virgin Mary, whatever they
might have thought before, they can no more refrain from shedding tears
than if they had seen the very persons recorded in sacred history. It is not
the picture, but the associations connected with it, that produce the effect.
Just as if the same young lady and her mother had been told, “that is the
Emperor Alexander,” they would say, “<em>what a handsome man!</em>” or if they
were shown the Prince Regent, would exclaim, “<em>how elegant!</em>”’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_412'>412</a>. After <em>professed objects</em> add: ‘Positive encouragements and rewards will not
make an honest man, or a great artist. The assumed familiarity, and
condescending goodness of patrons and vice-patrons will serve to intoxicate
rather than to sober the mind, and a card to dinner in Cleveland-row or
Portland-place, will have a tendency to divert the student’s thoughts from
his morning’s work, rather than to rivet them upon it. The device by
which a celebrated painter has represented the Virgin teaching the infant
Christ to read by pointing with a butterfly to the letters of the alphabet,
has not been thought a very wise one. Correggio is the most melancholy
instance on record of the want of a proper encouragement of the arts: but
a golden shower of patronage, tempting as that which fell into the lap of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>his own Danae, and dropping prize medals and epic mottoes, would not
produce another Correggio!’</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#Page_412'>412</a>. <em>In general.</em> This paragraph, and parts of those which follow, were ‘lifted’
from <cite>The Champion</cite> article into <cite>The Round Table</cite>, as well as here. See
vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 163, and notes thereto.</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>highest excellence</em> add: ‘The diffusion of taste is not, then, the same
thing as the improvement of taste; but it is only the former of these
objects that is promoted by public institutions and other artificial means.’</p>

<p class='c000'>After <em>smatterers in taste</em> add: ‘The principle of universal suffrage, however
applicable to matters of government, which concern the common feelings
and common interests of society, is by no means applicable to matters of
taste, which can only be decided upon by the most refined understandings.
It is throwing down the barriers which separate knowledge and feeling
from ignorance and vulgarity, and proclaiming a Bartholomew-fair-show
of the fine arts—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>‘The public taste is, therefore, necessarily vitiated, in proportion as it is
public; it is lowered with every infusion it receives of common opinion.
The greater the number of judges, the less capable must they be of judging,
for the addition to the number of good ones will always be small, while the
multitude of bad ones is endless, and thus the decay of art may be said to
be the necessary consequence of its progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘Can there be a greater confirmation of these remarks than to look at
the texture of that assemblage of select critics, who every year visit the
exhibition at Somerset-house from all parts of the metropolis of this
united kingdom? Is it at all wonderful that for such a succession of
connoisseurs, such a collection of works of art should be provided; where
the eye in vain seeks relief from the glitter of the frames in the glare of the
pictures; where vermillion cheeks make vermillion lips look pale; where
the merciless splendour of the painter’s pallet puts nature out of countenance;
and where the unmeaning grimace of fashion and folly is almost the
only variety in the wide dazzling waste of colour. Indeed, the great error
of British art has hitherto been a desire to produce popular effect by the
cheapest and most obvious means, and at the expence of every thing else;—to
lose all the delicacy and variety of nature in one undistinguished
bloom of florid health, and all precision, truth, and refinement of
character in the same harmless mould of smiling, self-complacent insipidity,</p>

<p class='c000'>‘It is probable that in all that stream of idleness and curiosity which
flows in, hour after hour, and day after day, to the richly hung apartments
of Somerset-house, there are not fifty persons to be found who can really
distinguish “a Guido from a Daub,” or who would recognise a work of
the most refined genius from the most common and every-day performance.
Come, then, ye banks of Wapping, and classic haunts of Ratcliffe-highway,
and join thy fields, blithe Tothill—let the postchaises, gay with oaken
boughs, be put in requisition for school-boys from Eton and Harrow, and
school-girls from Hackney and Mile-end,—and let a jury be empannelled
to decide on the merits of Raphael, and——. The verdict will be infallible.
We remember having been formerly a good deal amused with seeing a
smart, handsome-looking Quaker lad, standing before a picture of Christ as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>the saviour of the world, with a circle of young female friends around him,
and a newspaper in his hand, out of which he read to his admiring auditors
a criticism on the picture ascribing to it every perfection, human and divine.—Now,
in truth, the colouring was any thing but solemn, the drawing any
thing but grand, the expression any thing but sublime. The friendly critic
had, however, bedaubed it so with praise, that it was not easy to gainsay
its wondrous excellence. In fact, one of the worst consequences of the
establishment of academies, &amp;c. is, that the rank and station of the painter
throw a lustre round his pictures, which imposes completely on the herd of
spectators, and makes it a kind of treason against the art, for any one to
speak his mind freely, or detect the imposture. If, indeed, the election to
title and academic honours went by merit, this might form a kind of clue
or standard for the public to decide justly upon:—but we have heard that
genius and taste determine precedence there, almost as little as at court;
and that modesty and talent stand very little chance indeed with interest,
cabal, impudence, and cunning. The purity or liberality of professional
decisions cannot, therefore, in such cases be expected to counteract the
tendency which an appeal to the public has to lower the standard of taste.
The artist, to succeed, must let himself down to the level of his judges, for
he cannot raise them up to his own. The highest efforts of genius, in
every walk of art, can never be properly understood by mankind in general:
there are numberless beauties and truths which lie far beyond their comprehension.
It is only as refinement or sublimity are blended with other
qualities of a more obvious and common nature, that they pass current
with the world. Common sense, which has been sometimes appealed to as
the criterion of taste, is nothing but the common capacity, applied to
common facts and feelings; but it neither is, nor pretends to be, the judge
of any thing else.—To suppose that it can really appreciate the excellence
of works of high art, is as absurd as to suppose that it could produce them.’
[The article in <cite>The Champion</cite> ends with the paragraph ‘Taste is the highest....
Falcon is forgotten,’ which forms the conclusion of <cite>The Round Table</cite>
article also. See vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> p. 164. What follows is in the form of a Letter
to the Editor of <cite>The Champion</cite>, October 2, 1814.]</p>

<p class='c000'>‘<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I beg to offer one or two explanations with respect to the article
on the subject of public institutions for the promotion of the Fine Arts,
which does not appear to me to have been exactly understood by “A
<span class='sc'>Student of the Royal Academy</span>.”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c011'><sup>[92]</sup></a> The whole drift of that article is
to explode the visionary theory, that art may go on in an infinite series of
imitation and improvement. This theory has not a single fact or argument
to support it. All the highest efforts of art originate in the imitation of
nature, and end there. No imitation of others can carry us beyond this
point, or ever enable us to reach it. The imitation of the works of genius
facilitates the acquisition of a certain degree of excellence, but weakens and
distracts while it facilitates, and renders the acquisition of the highest degree
of excellence impossible. Wherever the greatest individual genius has been
exerted upon the finest models of nature, there the greatest works of art
have been produced,—the Greek statues and the Italian pictures. There is
no substitute in art for nature; in proportion as we remove from this
original source, we dwindle into mediocrity and flimsiness, and whenever
the artificial and systematic assistance afforded to genius becomes extreme,
it overlays it altogether. We cannot make use of other men’s minds, any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>more than of their limbs.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a> Art is not science, nor is the progress made in
the one ever like the progress made in the other. The one is retrograde
for the very same reason that the other is progressive; because science is
mechanical, and art is not, and in proportion as we rely on mechanical
means, we lose the essence. Is there a single exception to this rule? The
worst artists in the world are the modern Italians, who lived in the midst
of the finest works of art:—the persons least like the Greek sculptors are
the modern French painters, who copy nothing but the antique. Velasquez
might be improved by a pilgrimage to the Vatican, but if it had been his
morning’s lounge, it would have ruined him. Michael Angelo, the cartoons
of Leonardi da Vinci, and the antique, your correspondent tells us, produced
Raphael. Why have they produced no second Raphael? What produced
Michael Angelo, Leonardi da Vinci, and the antique? Surely not Michael
Angelo, Leonardi da Vinci, and the antique! If Sir Joshua Reynolds
would never have observed a certain expression in nature, if he had not
seen it in Correggio, it is tolerably certain that he would never execute it
so well; and in fact, though Sir Joshua was largely indebted to Correggio,
yet his imitations are not equal to the originals. The two little boys in
Correggio’s <cite>Danae</cite> are worth all the children Sir Joshua ever painted: and
the Hymen in the same picture, (with leave be it spoken,) is worth all his
works put together.—But the student of the Royal Academy thinks that
Carlo Maratti, and Raphael Mengs are only exceptions to the common rule
of progressive improvement in the art. If these are the exceptions, where
are the examples? If we are to credit him, and it would be uncivil not to
do it, they are to be found in the present students of the Royal Academy,
whom, he says, it would be unreasonable to confound with such minds as
those of Carlo Maratti, and Raphael Mengs. Be it so. This is a point to
be decided by time.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘The whole question was at once decided by the person who said that
“<em>to imitate the Iliad, was not to imitate Homer</em>.” After this has once been
stated, it is quite in vain to argue the point farther. The idea of piling art
on art, and heaping excellence on excellence, is a mere fable; and we may
very safely say, that the frontispiece of all such pretended institutions and
academies for the promotion of the fine arts, founded on this principle,
and “pointing to the skies,” should be—</p>

      <div class='line'>“Like a tall bully, lifts the head, and lies.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>‘Absurd as this theory is, it flatters our vanity and our indolence, and
these are two great points gained. It is gratifying to suppose that art
may have gone on from the beginning, reposing upon art, like the Indian
elephant and the tortoise, that it has improved, and will still go on improving,
without the trouble of going back to nature. By these theorists, nature
is always kept in the back-ground, or does not even terminate the vista in
their prospects. She is a mistress too importunate, and who requires too
great sacrifices from the effeminacy of modern amateurs. They will only
see her in company, or by proxy, and are as much afraid of being reduced
to their shifts with her in private, as <cite>Tattle in Love for Love</cite>,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> was afraid of
being left alone with a pretty girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘I can only recollect one other thing to reply to. Your correspondent
objects to my having said, “All the great painters of this period were
thoroughly grounded in the first principles of their art; had learned to
copy a head, a hand, or an eye,” &amp;c. All this knowledge of detail he
attributes to academical instruction, and quotes Sir Joshua Reynolds, who
says of himself—“Not having had the advantage of an early academical
education, I never had that facility in drawing the naked figure, which an
artist ought to have.” First, I might answer, that the drawing from casts
can never assist the student in copying the face, the eye, or the extremities;
and that it was only of service in the knowledge of the trunk, and the
general proportions, which are comparatively lost in the style of English
art, which is not naked, but clothed. Secondly, I would say, with respect
to Sir Joshua, that his inability to draw the naked figure arose from his not
having been accustomed to draw it; and that drawing from the antique
would not have enabled either him or any one else to draw from the naked
figure. The difficulty of copying from nature, or in other words of doing
any thing that has not been done before, or that is worth doing, is that
of combining many ideas at once, or of reconciling things in motion:
whereas in copying from the antique, you have only to copy still life, and
in proportion as you get a knack at the one, you disqualify yourself for the
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>‘As to what your correspondent adds of painting and poetry being the
same thing, it is an old story which I do not believe. But who would
ever think of setting up a school of poetry? Byshe’s<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Art of Poetry and
the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gradus ad Parnassum</span></cite>, are a jest. Royal Academies and British
Institutions are to painting, what Byshe’s Art of Poetry and the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gradus
ad Parnassum</span></cite>, are to the “sister art.” Poetry, as it becomes artificial,
becomes bad, instead of good—the poetry of words, instead of things.
Milton is the only poet who gave to borrowed materials the force of
originality. I am, Sir, Your humble Servant,</p>

<p class='c000'>WHY THE ARTS ARE NOT PROGRESSIVE?</p>

<p class='c000'>[Under the above heading appeared the second of two articles in the <cite>Morning
Chronicle</cite> (Jan. 11 and 15, 1814). See vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> <cite>The Round Table</cite>, note to p. 160.
The following passages were not used in <cite>The Round Table</cite> paper.]</p>

<p class='c000'>Science and the mechanic arts depend not on the force with which the mind
itself is endued, or with which it contemplates given things (for this is naturally
much the same) but on the number of things, successively perceived by the same
or different persons, and formally arranged and registered in books or memory,
which admits of being varied and augmented indefinitely. The number of objects to
which the understanding may be directed is endless, and the results, so far as they
are positive, tangible things, may be set down and added one to another, and made
use of as occasion requires, without creating any confusion, and so as to produce a
perpetual accumulation of useful knowledge. What is once gained is never lost,
and may be multiplied daily, because this increase of knowledge does not depend
upon increasing the force of the mind, but on directing the same force to different
things, all of them in their nature definite, demonstrable, existing to the mind
outwardly and by signs, less as the power than as the form of truth, and in which
all the difficulty lies in the first invention, not in the subsequent communication.
In like manner the mechanic parts of painting for instance, such as the mode of
preparing colours, the laws of perspective, etc., which may be taught by rule and
method, so that the principle being once known, every one may avail himself of it,
these subordinate and instrumental parts of the art admit of uniform excellence,
though from accidental causes it has happened otherwise. But it is not so in art itself,
in its higher and nobler essence. ‘There is no shuffling,’ but ‘we ourselves compelled
to give in evidence even to the teeth and forehead of our faults.’<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> There
is no room for the division of labour—for the accumulation of borrowed advantages;
no artificial scale by which <em>to heaven we may ascend</em>; because here excellence does
not depend on the quantity of representative knowledge, abstracted from a variety
of subjects, but on the original force of capacity, and degree of attention, applied to
the same given subject, natural feelings and images. To use the distinction of a
technical philosophy, science depends on the discursive or <em>extensive</em>—art on the
intuitive and <em>intensive</em> power of the mind. One chemical or mathematical
discovery may be added to another, because the degree and sort of faculty required
to apprehend and retain them, are in both cases the same; but no one can
voluntarily add the colouring of Rubens to the expression of Raphael, till he has
the same eye for colour as Rubens, and for expression as Raphael—that is, the most</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>thorough feeling of what is profound in the one, or splendid in the other—of what
no rules can teach, nor words convey—and of what the mind must possess within
itself, and by a kind of participation with nature, or remain for ever destitute of it.
Titian and Correggio are the only painters who united to perfect colouring a
degree of expression, the one in his portraits, and the other in his histories, all but
equal, if not equal, to the highest. But this union of different qualities they had
from nature, and not by method. In fact, we judge of science by the number of
effects produced—of art by the energy which produces them. The one is knowledge—the
other power.</p>

<p class='c000'>What have we left to console us for all this? Why, we have Mr. Rogers’s
‘Pleasures of Memory,’ and Mr. Campbell’s ‘Pleasures of Hope’; Mr. Westall’s
pictures, and all West’s; Miss Burney’s new novel (which is, however, some comfort),
Miss Edgeworth’s Fashionable Tales, Madame de Staël’s next work, whatever

<p class='c021'>[See Note to page <a href='#Page_326'>326</a>.]</p>

<p class='c000'>Report from the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Elgin
Marbles.—<span class='sc'>Murray.</span></p>

<p class='c000'>The Elgin Marbles are the best answer to Sir Joshua Reynolds’s <cite>Discourses</cite>. Considered
in that point of view, they are invaluable: in any other, they are not
worth so much as has been said. Nothing remains of them but their style; but
that is everything, for it is the style of nature. Art is the imitation of nature;
and the Elgin Marbles are in their essence and their perfection casts from nature,—from
fine nature, it is true, but from real, living, moving nature; from objects
in nature, answering to an idea in the artist’s mind, not from an idea in the
artist’s mind abstracted from all objects in nature. Already these Marbles have
produced a revolution in our artists’ minds, and Mr. West says, in his practice:
The venerable President makes an express distinction in their favour between
<em>dignified</em> art and <em>systematic</em> art. Mr. Chauntry considers simplicity and grandeur
so nearly united in them, that it is almost impossible to separate them. Sir
Thomas Laurence in returning from the Elgin Marbles to his own house, where
he has casts of the finest antiques, was struck with the greater degree of ease and
nature in the former. Mr. Flaxman alone holds out for the <em>ideal</em>. The whole of
his evidence on this subject is, indeed, quite ideal: Mr. Payne Knight’s evidence
is <em>learned</em> evidence.—It is to be hoped, however, that these Marbles with the name
of Phidias thrown into the scale of common sense, may lift the Fine Arts out of
the Limbo of vanity and affectation into which they were conjured in this country
about fifty years ago, and in which they have lain sprawling and fluttering, gasping
for breath, wasting away, vapid and abortive ever since,—the shadow of a shade.
The benefit of high examples of Art, is to prevent the mischievous effect of bad
ones. A true theory of Art does not advance the student one step in practice,
one hair’s-breadth nearer the goal of excellence: but it takes the fetters from off
his feet, and loosens the bandages from his eyes. We lay somewhat more stress
on the value of the Fine Arts than Mr. Payne Knight, who considers them (we
know not for what reason) as an elegant antithesis to morality. We think they
are nearly related to it. All morality seems to be little more than keeping people
out of mischief, as we send children to school; and the Fine Arts are in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>respect a school of morality. They bribe the senses into the service of the
understanding: they kill Time, the great enemy of man; they employ the
mind usefully—about nothing; and by preventing <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, promote the chief ends
of virtue. A taste for the Fine Arts also, in periods of luxury and refinement, not
ill supplies the place of religious enthusiasm. It feeds our love and admiration of
the grand, the good, the beautiful. What is the respect which is felt for the
names of Raphael, of Michael Angelo, of Phidias, of Homer and of Milton, but a
sort of hero worship, only with this difference, that in the one case we pay an
indistinct homage to the powers of the mind, whereas the worshippers of Theseus
and Hercules deified the powers and virtues of the body?</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the tendency of the works here collected to promote the Fine
Arts in this country, though not so sanguine as some persons, or even as the
Committee of the House of Commons, we are not without our hopes.—The only
possible way to improve the taste for art in a country, is by a collection of standing
works of established reputation, and which are capable by the sanctity of their
name of overawing the petulance of public opinion. This result can never be
produced by the encouragement given to the works of contemporary artists. The
public ignorance will much sooner debauch them than they will reform the want
of taste in the public. But where works of the highest character and excellence
are brought forward in a manner due to their merits, and rendered accessible to
the public, though they may do little for the national genius, it is hard if they do
not add something to the public taste. In this way also they may react upon the
production of original excellence. It was in this point of view that the Gallery
of the Louvre was of the greatest importance not only to France, but to Europe.
It was a means to civilise the world. There Art lifted up her head and was
seated on her throne, and said, All eyes shall see me, and all knees shall bow to
me. Honour was done to her and all hers. There was her treasure, and there
the inventory of all she had. There she had gathered together all her pomp, and
there was her shrine, and there her votaries came and worshipped as in a temple.
The crown she wore was brighter than that of kings. Where the triumphs of
human liberty had been, there were the triumphs of human genius. For there, in
the Louvre, were the precious monuments of art;—there ‘stood the statue that
enchants the world’;<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a> there was the <cite>Apollo</cite>, the <cite>Laocoon</cite>, the <cite>Dying Gladiator</cite>, the
<cite>Head of the Antinous</cite>, <cite>Diana</cite> with her <cite>Fawn</cite>, the <cite>Muses</cite> and the <cite>Graces</cite> in a ring,
and all the glories of the antique world:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There was old Proteus coming from the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wreathed Triton blew his winding horn.’<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There, too, were the two <cite>St. Jeromes</cite>, Correggio’s and Domenichino’s; there was
Raphael’s <cite>Transfiguration</cite>, the <cite>St. Mark</cite> of Tintoret, Paul Veronese’s <cite>Marriage of
Cana</cite>, the <cite>Deluge</cite> of Nicholas Poussin, and Titian’s <cite>St. Peter Martyr</cite>;—all these
and more than these, of which the world was not worthy. The worshippers of
hereditary power and native imbecility wanted at first to destroy these monuments
of human genius, which give the eternal lie to their creed; they did not dare to
do that, they have dispersed them, and they have done well. They were an
insult to the assembled majesty of hereditary power and native imbecility, both in
the genius that had produced them, and that had acquired them; and <em>it was fit
that they should be removed</em>. They were an obstacle in the way, in case the great
Duke should have to teach the great nation another great moral lesson by the
burning of Paris, which has been a favourite object with some persons since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>year 1792, and with others later; and <em>it was fit that they should be removed</em>. The
French themselves did not think proper to defend what they had dearly bought
with their blood, shed for their country, and <em>it was fit that they should be removed</em>.
Besides these reasons, there were no others for their removal. The reason assigned
in the Duke of Wellington’s letter, that the works of art should be sacred to
conquerors, and an heir-loom of the soil that gives them birth, is quite apocryphal.
Half of the works brought from Italy had been originally brought there from
Greece. If works of art are to be a sort of fixtures in every country, why are the
Elgin Marbles brought here, for our artists to strut and fret over this acquisition
to our ‘glorious country’? If the French were not to retain their collection of
perfect works of art, why should we be allowed to make one of still higher pretensions
under pretence of carrying off only fragments and rubbish? The Earl of
Elgin brought away the Theseus and the Neptune as bits of architecture, as loose
pieces of stone; but no sooner do they get into the possession of our glorious
country, than they are discovered to be infinitely superior to the <cite>Apollo</cite>, the <cite>Venus</cite>,
and the <cite>Laocoon</cite>, and all the rest of that class, which are found out to be no
better than <em>modern antiques</em>. All this may be true, but it is truth with a suspicious
appearance. If works of art are contemplated with peculiar interest on the spot
which gave them birth, surely Athens has charms for the eyes of learning and
taste as well as Rome. If there is something classical in the very air of Venice,
of Antwerp, and of Rotterdam, surely there is an air at Athens which is breathed
nowhere else.</p>

<p class='c000'>If this reasoning would apply to such works in their perfect state, it does so still
more in their approaches to decay and ruin, for then the local interest belonging
to them becomes the principal impression. Lord Elgin appears not to have had
the slightest authority for bringing away these statues, except a <em>fermaun</em> or permission
from the Turkish Government to bring away pieces of stone from the
ruins of the Parthenon, which he paid 21,000 piastres to the Governor of Athens
for permission to interpret as he pleased. That it was not meant to apply to the
statues, and only to fragments of the buildings, is also evident from this, that
Lord Elgin had originally, and at the time the <em>fermaun</em> was granted, no intention,
as he himself says, of bringing away the statues. Lord Aberdeen approves of
bringing them away, because otherwise the French might have got them. In
what we have said, we do not blame Lord Elgin for what he has done; all our
feelings run the contrary way. We only blame cant and hypocrisy: we only
blame those who blame others, and yet would do the very same things themselves.
There does not appear to be any evidence that these statues were done by Phidias.
It seems extremely probable, however, that they were done by persons under his
direction, and in a style that he approved. What that style is, and what the
principles of art are which are to be derived from it, we shall briefly attempt to
state in another article on this interesting subject.</p>

most polite reception, shewed them whatever they expressed a wish to see, asked
them to dinner, and after passing the day in the greatest conviviality, dismissed
them by saying, ‘That they might get out as they got in.’ This was certainly a
good jest. Our youthful adventurers on forbidden ground, in the midst of their

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r12'>12</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One would think that a people so devoted to perfumes, who deal in essences
and scents, and have fifty different sorts of snuffs, would be equally nice, and
offended at the approach of every disagreeable odour. Not so. They seem to
have no sense of the disagreeable in smells or tastes, as if their heads were stuffed
with a cold, and hang over a dunghill, as if it were a bed of roses, or swallow the
most detestable dishes with the greatest relish. The nerve of their sensibility is
bound up at the point of pain. A Frenchman (as far as I can find) has no idea
answering to the word <em>nasty</em>; or if he has, feels a predilection for, instead of an
aversion to, it. So in morals they bid fair to be the <em>Sybarites</em> of the modern
world. They make the best of every thing (which is a virtue)—and treat the
worst with levity or complaisance (which is a vice). They harbour no antipathies.
They would swallow Gil Blas’s supper as a luxury, and boast of it afterwards as a
feat. Their moral system is not sustained by the two opposite principles of
attraction and repulsion, for they are shocked at nothing: what excites horror or
disgust in other minds, they consider as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bagatelle</span></i>; it is resolved into an abstraction
of agreeable sensations, a source of amusement. There is an oil of self-complacency
in their constitutions, which takes the sting out of evil, and neutralizes
the poison of corruption. They, therefore, can commit atrocities with impunity,
and wallow in disgrace without a blush, as no other people can. There is Monsieur
Chateaubriand, for instance. Who would not suppose that the very echo of his
own name would hoot him out of the world? So far from it, his pamphlet <cite>On

Claude there is the French <em>finicalness</em>, and love of minute details; but there is a
<em>fusion</em> of all these into the most perfect harmony from the influence of a southern
sky, and he has none of the flimsiness or littleness of effect, to which his countrymen
are prone. Again, it cannot be denied that there is a certain setness and
formality, a <em>didactic</em> or prosing vein in Nicolas Poussin’s compositions. He proceeds
on system, has a deliberate purpose to make out, and is often laboured,
monotonous, and extravagant. His pictures are the finest subjects in the world
for French criticism—to point the moral, or detach an episode. He is somewhat
pedantic and over-significant, in the manner of French orators and poets. He
had, like his countrymen, no great eye for nature or truth of expression; but he
had what they chiefly want—<em>imagination</em>, or the power of placing himself in the
circumstances of others. Poussin, in fact, held a middle place between Raphael
and other painters of the Italian school, who have embodied the highest poetry of
expression, and the common run of French artists, whose utmost stretch of invention
reaches no farther than correctness in the costume and chronology of their
subject.</p>

this scene in all his plays, except Titus Andronicus, which is full of the same
tragic exaggeration and tautology. I was walking out (this 1st of October—a
clear grey autumnal morning) in the gardens of the Tuileries, and seeing the long,
tall avenue of trees before me that leads up to the barrier of Neuilly, it put me in
mind of former times, of prints and pictures of the scenery and roads in foreign
countries which I had been used to from a child, with the old-fashioned look of
every thing around Paris, as if it were the year 1724, instead of 1824, till the
view before me seemed to become part of a dream, or to transport me into past
time, or to raise itself up in my imagination, like a picture in the ‘Pilgrim’s
Progress.’ I wondered whether Buonaparte sometimes thought of this view when
he was at St. Helena. I checked myself in this strain of speculation as overcharged
and disproportioned to the occasion, according to the correct and elegant
taste of the people where I was, when on a post opposite, I saw stuck up in large
letters, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pension de l’Univers</span></i>,’ meaning a tenpenny ordinary. These are the people
that are continually crying out against the extravagance and bombast of their
neighbours. Their imagination runs to the ends of the universe, when it has
nothing but words to carry—no people so magnificent, so prodigal of professions,
so hyperbolical as they—add but meaning or a weight of feeling to them, and they
complain bitterly of the load, and throw it off as barbarous, intolerable, Gothic,
and uncouth. It is not the extravagance of the style, then, with which they
quarrel, but the palpableness of the imagery which gives a blow to their slender
intellectual <em>stamina</em>, or the accumulation of feeling about it with which they have
not firmness or comprehension to grapple. ‘Dip it in the ocean, and it will stand’—says
Sterne’s barber of the buckle of his wig. They magnify trifles, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>;
it is only when a poor struggling attempt is to be made to gain relief from the
‘perilous stuff that weighs upon the heart,’ or to embody the swelling conceptions
of the soul in remote and lofty images, that they shrink back with the timidity of
women and the formality of pedants.</p>

a rival in bodily imperfection, and after insisting that the other had both hands
and feet, exclaimed emphatically, ‘Mais moi, je suis unique.’ My old acquaintance
(Dr. Stoddart) used formerly to recount this trait of French character very triumphantly,
but then it was in war-time. He may think it indecent to have here
hinted any such thing of an individual of a nation with whom we are at peace.
At present, he seems to have become a sort of portent and by-word himself among
English politicians; and without head or heart may exclaim—‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais moi, je suis
unique!</span></i>‘—See his late articles on the Spanish Refugees, &amp;c. Would such a man
have been any better, had he never turned renegade, or had he become (his first
ambition) a revolutionary leader? Would he not have been as blood-thirsty, as
bigoted, as perverse and ridiculous on the side of the question he left, as on the
one he has come over to? It imports little what men are, so long as they are

kept his countenance with great gravity and decorum, and turned round with a

form new combinations every moment. It is commonly too light and variable
for repose; it is careless, indifferent, but not sunk in indolence, nor wedded to
ease: as on the other hand, it is restless, rapid, extravagant, without depth or
force. Is it not the same with their feelings, which are alike incapable of a habit
of quiescence, or of persevering action or passion? It seems so to me. Their
freedom from any tendency to drunkenness, to indulge in its dreamy stupor, or
give way to its incorrigible excesses, confirms by analogy the general view of their
character. I do not bring this as an accusation against them, I ask if it is not the
fact; and if it will not account for many things observable in them, good, bad,
and indifferent? In a word, mobility without <em>momentum</em> solves the whole riddle
of the French character.</p>

which expresses what is creditable, and the other what is disgraceful. Is it that
the sense of vanity absorbs every other consideration, turning the sense of shame,

ostentation in a display of talent into a flagrant impropriety? I do not lay much

the Elgin Marbles, as they are arranged with great care and some pomp in the
British Museum. They may smile to see that we are willing to remove works of
art from their original places of abode, though we will not allow others to do so.
These noble fragments of antiquity might startle our fastidious neighbours a little
at first from their rude state and their simplicity, but I think they would gain
upon them by degrees, and convince their understandings, if they did not subdue
their affections. They are indeed an equally instructive lesson and unanswerable
rebuke to them and to us—to them for thinking that finishing every
part <em>alike</em> is perfection, and to us who imagine that to leave every part alike
unfinished is grandeur. They are as remote from finicalness as grossness, and
combine the parts with the whole in the manner that nature does. Every part
is given, but not ostentatiously, and only as it would appear in the circumstances.
There is an alternate action and repose. If one muscle is strained, another is
proportionably relaxed. If one limb is in action and another at rest, they come
under a different law, and the muscles are not brought out nor the skin tightened
in the one as in the other. There is a flexibility and sway of the limbs and of the
whole body. The flesh has the softness and texture of flesh, not the smoothness
or stiffness of stone. There is an undulation and a liquid flow on the surface, as
the breath of genius moved the mighty mass: they are the finest forms in the
most striking attitudes, and with every thing in its place, proportion, and degree,
uniting the ease, truth, force, and delicacy of Nature. They shew nothing but
the artist’s thorough comprehension of, and entire docility to that great teacher.
There is no <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitreship</span></i>, no pedantry, no attempt at a display of science, or at
forcing the parts into an artificial symmetry, but it is like cutting a human body
out of a block of marble, and leaving it to act for itself with all the same springs,
levers, and internal machinery. It was said of Shakspeare’s dramas, that they
were the <em>logic of passion</em>; and it may be affirmed of the Elgin Marbles, that they
are the <em>logic of form</em>.—One part being given, another cannot be otherwise than it
is. There is a mutual understanding and re-action throughout the whole frame.
The Apollo and other antiques are not equally simple and severe. The limbs
have too much an appearance of being cased in marble, of making a display of
every recondite beauty, and of balancing and answering to one another, like the
rhymes in verse. The Elgin Marbles are harmonious, flowing, varied prose. In
a word, they are like casts after the finest nature. Any cast from nature, however
inferior, is in the same style. Let the French and English sculptors make
casts continually. The one will see in them the parts everywhere given—the
other will see them everywhere given in subordination to, and as forming materials
for a whole.</p>

pointing to ——’s Lives of the Popes, containing all the abominations (public and

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
